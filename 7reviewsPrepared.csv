damn drape prickles dont eat possibly could kill u poke ur sides
one favorite granolas ive ever had vegan whoops glutenfree too thought saw certified gf package somewhere false advertising now give try
probably favorite cereal right next special k dark chocolate
 wasnt fan though would raspberries overly sweet all kind bland hint chocolate mom enjoyed good cuz diabetic  cant much sweet stuff better alternative granola
personally get sick buying brands advertise healthy high quality add cheap filler ingredients save mere pennies use brand name like natures path fluff words like nongmo ingredients like cane sugar third ingredientand therefor big portion eatingis soy oilthere many alternatives known processed soy causes stomach issues lot us save couple pennies could easily used cottonseed palm number alternatives cause issues many people sadly buying love crunch worth discomfort causes eat it buy local chains organic brand less uses canola oil less unnecessary ingredients like chocolate flavor rice starch
liked taste
love yogurt little pieces chocolate right touch
love granola good price it

excellent great taste makes delicious salsa
great product easy use
great way use garden tomatoes quality salsa cans well hot super mild either
love product easy make seasoning even used make dip using cream cheese ive used seasoning make enchiladas extra kick family loves
easy gets make salsa tub canning big batch salsa isalso great make many small batches fresh salsa looking forward fresh garden tomatoes mean time use  one oz fire roasted petite diced tomatoes tbsp seasoning tbsp cider vinegar mix wait hour end pretty tasty salsa
makes best salsa ever put up add extra chopped onions extra chopped jalapeños superb
its individual packs would store fresh something flavor isnt same mix use get seasonings
makes best salsa perfect flavor
used prep ingredients make salsa garden tedious results vary sometimes great sometimes great using tomatos mix good reliable far easier well worth money imo
excellent results quick easy way makes great salsa
