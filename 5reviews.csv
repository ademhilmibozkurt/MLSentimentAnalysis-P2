"The only problem, I actually counted the amount in the box. There were only 59 in the box, not 60",4.0
Me and my wife and my kids love them,5.0
Definitely one of the best candies you can buy for selling at school. First of all they don't melt while in a backpack for hours. Second of all you can make an 80% profit margin by selling 2 airheads for $1. And last of all I sold all 60 airheads in just 4 days!,5.0
"The price is great, but there are mostly grape and orange flavors in the box.",3.0
"Box and packaging in great shape, kids love them.",5.0
Good price,5.0
I bought these for my grandson who lives a few hours away from us.and he loved them. He asked me to send him some more. There was alot of different flavors and that was the best part. They are very affordable and will be sending more often.,5.0

"They aren‚Äôt very soft, but taste good.",4.0
"I have always LOVED these! As much as my kids. I've included them in care packages for the homeless, as well. I am DONE with these after buying enough of these large boxes of ASSORTED FRUIT flavor snacks, o ly to throw away 75% if them because I cannot stand the CARROT flavored ones, and I'm sorry but I guess I missed the part in nutrition class about carrot being a fruit. Wow. This is unacceptable and I want so much money back.",2.0
"These are so much more healthy than reaching for candy when you want something sweet. They aren't sweet though, just flavorful.",5.0
"Kids love them, everyone loves them.  Always tasty and don't taste artificial like some brands.  You would be able to tell the difference in a blind fold test!",5.0

Good treat,5.0
Stale chips and no air in the bags and only a partial refund don‚Äôt buy!!,1.0
I buy these regularly for my kiddos because they insist the little bags taste better than the big bag üôÑ But at least I can get the little bags at a decent price! I agree they are always fresh and this ends up being a great buy - and easier to travel with the smaller bags too!,5.0
Perfect size and a good price.  Great for lunches for kids or parties or a  beach day!,5.0

The chips were stalled.,1.0
I like the price of them and good for school lunch,5.0
"Most of the chips are just plain tortilla chips, there‚Äôs so little seasoning in these that eating a bag becomes disappointing. Every maybe 1 in five or six bags there will be a decently seasoned chip.",1.0

I like the quality of the popcorn and the perfect portion packaging.,5.0
"The first 2 boxes of 40 were fine but this time 2 of the bags were open on the bottom and there was some loose, stale popcorn in the box. There was no damage to the box so this must have happened at the factory. The white cheddar popcorn is awesome but it's not worth it if I can't count on receiving edible product.",3.0
Arrived as stated bags were not crushed. It‚Äôs a favorite snack at my house. Low in calories and personal size bags are perfect.,5.0
"I have ordered this popcorn a few times. I enjoy the flavor, not to bad on carbs either. The low rating is due to the 7 dollar price increase. I understand prices will go up, but not by 7 bucks overnight!  I will not order from this seller again unless they decide to go back down on the huge price increase.",2.0
"They arrived in May, ""Guaranteed Fresh ....until 4 July 2023.""  we opened the carton. they are stale.",1.0

Highly recommend, I‚Äôve bought multiple times before and will be buying again.",5.0
"I received the chips on May 24th and they expire on July 18th. The chips were a little stale but still ok to eat. Guess I‚Äôll be eating these up quickly. Honestly, you shouldn‚Äôt sell chips in this quantity with expiration dates so close to the purchase date.",2.0
"A huge waste of plastic etc., very bad for the earth and for health, but at least I don't end up eating a whole ""party size"" bag.YMMV.",5.0

This is not a freebie for review situation!I just noticed so many concerns about the dates. Hope this helps!",5.0
Love this just enough  .,5.0
"I love these, but there was less than a month before the ‚Äúbest by‚Äù date when received.  Not only that, but this order - I‚Äôve got them on subscribe and save - tasted of rancid oil.  Not sure if that‚Äôs a function of the date or if it was just a bad batch, but this order was inedible!",1.0

"My long time FAVORITE Extra Sugar Free stick-gum Flavor, and one that i ALWAYS prefer to buy, long as the price doesn't get too far above what other Extra Flavors 'same boxed packs' cost.  Still not something i should chew too many times a day but, i do sometimes lose track, knowing that 'synthetic' sweeteners while low in carbs, still can (long term), damage our internal health.  Regardless, this is a Great tasting sugar-free Gum!!",5.0

I love the taste and I chewed the gum myself.,5.0

I love this gum. It lasts a long time and tastes great!,5.0

"Commercial popper , lots of un popped kernels, took 3 shows to pop it all and did not notice a difference in in pop ratio to duds in bottom tray. I did expect a higher ratio for gourmet popcorn compared to the big bulk bags, will probably go back to the big bags and zip lock to keep the corn fresh once opening",4.0

Personally the hard cookies are my favorite. Not too pleased that you get like one or two oat raisin in a box which is my spouse's favorite.,4.0
The cookies were stuck together. They didn‚Äôt come in the original box. The one I tasted was stale. I looked for an ‚Äúout of date marking ‚Äú but couldn‚Äôt find one on the cookies. I gave a 1 star because that arrived on time. Won‚Äôt order these again!,1.0

"The price is amazing! Unbelievable and it taste really good! If you‚Äôre from the Caribbean and you like eating the ‚Äúbridge‚Äù snack, this taste just like it! It‚Äôs like a vanilla waffle cone snack, low key taste like icecream waffle lol  but yeah you should buy, kinda has crumbs when you‚Äôre eating, not a lot though. It doesn‚Äôt break away when you‚Äôre eating it‚Äôs sturdy which is good, came well packaged , I also got for my family and they loved it, kids and adults, it has a nice little crunch to it, it‚Äôs not tough and it‚Äôs not hard it‚Äôs just right. It‚Äôs not like a crackers though and it‚Äôs not a biscuit but it‚Äôs a nice snack.",5.0
"This vanilla flavored wafer is average!  It's not very sweet, it smells like vanilla, and the taste is so-so. The packaging is different from the supermarket, and it doesn't taste as delicious as the previous supermarket packaging. The price is also cheap.",2.0
Too waxy in taste and how it made our mouths feel.,1.0
I've had similar products from other brands at the same price so I tried these. Reminds me of rice cakes with a whiff of coconut.,1.0
"Fresh , delicious and easy open pull tab at one end of package. Not resealable but I stored them in a container I have . I definitely will continue buying these wafers . Was shocked how fresh , delicious & creamy vanilla wafers are .",5.0
"It you‚Äôre familiar with this style of wafer cookie, one of the joys of eating them is selecting one delicate crumb free wafer and tasting the delicate layers of wafer and vanilla melt in your mouth.  Amazon shipping makes that dream nearly impossible.  This is my second time ordering these hoping that they would at least wrap in bubblewrap or a box, but no they insist on throwing them loosely into a light paper envelope mailer.  Yes, crumbled rounded edges and crumbs everywhere when you open the cookie packaging.  I‚Äôll eat these without the joy of delicacy, but at least be able to enjoy the flavor.",4.0
Delicious and fresh,5.0
"Product came in perfect condition, good quality candy‚Äôs. Very decent price!",5.0
"Love these mints, nothing bad to say. If you're a texture person, something I've noticed with these mints is if you get the big bag like this, they're usually softer in texture. The smaller bags like you get off the 'pegs' at a store have a harder texture and more intense flavor, not that these are lacking though! Just a thing to note for your preferences.",5.0
My granddaughters obsession! lol! Great price!,5.0
They have great fruit flavors. The grandkids love them.,5.0

"Perfect size for kids to snack or take traveling. I hated opening a bag or buying a large container of gold fish as the kids either ate too many in one sitting or didn't feel like eating them over a few days, so larger containers went stale. I will continue buying gold fish this way!",5.0
The box came a little smashed but I opened it and everything was perfect. Great snack for kids. My daughter and her colleagues at school love it!,5.0

"they are stale, not fresh",1.0
"Ordered 2 boxes, one box was open on one end but individual cracker sleeves seem fine. Crackers were mostly intact, only a couple broken at the sleeve ends. Crackers taste funny, almost like a rancid buttery flavor, can't quite place it but I won't be ordering again, did not like the taste.",3.0

"Does not maintain structure, so good for soup or chili but not much else. Taste kinda bland/mild and low salt.Will finish what I have, but would not order again or suggest to others.",2.0
"These were the worst crackers I've ever had.  Bought two box's .  Every cracker you take out of package fall apart. First the top and bottom seperate then they fall completely apart. No good for toppings of any kind. Bought this brand a couple times before and they were fine, but why take a chance.These two box's were totally terrible. Two box's eight packages of garbage..  TERRIBLE",1.0
"I have gotten these before and they were ok, but, this time they were hard as a rock.  Will not buy again.",3.0
"These crackers give the appearance that they would be a good substitute for Triscuits.  Despite being well within expiration date, they were devoid of any flavor.  They are thin and hard as a rock, so much so that I feared breaking a crown or tooth.  Rather embarrassing; I put them out for guests and had to throw them away.",1.0

They taste great and are a simple grab and go item for the busy lifestyle. I usually have them in the morning when I don‚Äôt have time to make something before work.  I was actually surprised when I first tried them. I was expecting like the old fashion fig bars I had been accustomed to growing up.  These however are way better and they actually taste like the flavors they are (raspberry).,5.0

Problem with these is they over do the pretzels. Most bags I opened in both boxes I bought had a ton of pretzel sticks and the regular pretzels. Want a equal taste. I could buy pretzels for that but what fun would that be.,3.0
More bagel crisps I say!!!! Still a favorite snack of the entire family.,5.0
"I bought these before a long flight. I really like the convenience of the small bags which are easier to pack and good for portion control. Obviously the larger bag is cheaper per oz. but these are really good if you need/prefer a smaller amount of mix (flight, road trip, camping, etc.).The mix tasted just as good as the normal bag. Perfectly fine and fresh.",5.0
The best snack!,5.0

Tasty bars,5.0
Highly recommend,5.0
These bars taste awful.. They also coat your mouth and they are yucky!,1.0
"The taste is amazing, low sugar, and protein! I eat 2 every morning!",5.0
"I am trusting that this is a protein bar... because the flavor makes me think it is a delicious breakfast/candy bar! And not the overly sweet kind either - but mouthwatering flavorful. Seriously, these taste amazing, and the nutrition ratios (carbs vs fats vs proteins) are phenomenal for a snack that tastes this good. Not really Keto friendly with 10g of carbs - but great ratios if you are just going for low carb and want something sweet with decent protein and fat for ~220-ish calories.",5.0
rnative when on the go and need a snack. I find these pretty tasty compared to many protein bars I have tried.,5.0
These are always tasty and are great to take for snacks.  I take them to work and it's a better option than the company vending machine.,5.0
I have always loved power crunch bars and found that they are the best tasting protein bar on the market with the best nutritional value. Ordering these from amazon also has the best value. My favorite flavors so far and chocolate peanut butter and mint. I find that vanilla has a very artificial taste. My only complaint is that they are incredibly crumbly and messy and impossible to eat on the go  or in the car without a mess. All in all a very good product!,5.0
Best protein bars I‚Äôve ever had!,5.0
Snap into over 100 Slim Jim‚Äôs!,5.0

Perfect for on the go and super yummy,5.0
I like Slim Jim‚Äôs for snacking occasions.,5.0
Smaller than expected but taste was amazing... addictive to say the least it was still fresh when I got it,3.0
Love these as a guilty treat post-gym. However they are WAY TOO SALTY. Like almost 1000mg of salt in one stick. It is simply too much. Wish they were 50% as salty and 150% as spicy as they are. Probably won't be ordering again.,4.0
It‚Äôs may 05/23/23 and the best by date is may 05/7/23 :( the slim Jim isn‚Äôt like a fresh slim Jim. It‚Äôs hard and has an off flavor. Looks like I won‚Äôt order any more jerky off Amazon,2.0
The whole box is expired. And of course no returns.,1.0
I eat this for the protein. Good flavor and good price,5.0

It was perfectly lightly salted and just the perfect amount of butter! It was better than the kind at the movie theater and less greasy. I think it should be called Orville Readyandbetter.

Too much sugar and tastes like cheap chocolate. Never again.,1.0

Way too many calories for just 20g of proteins (330). No wonder why these are the cheapest. Do your research!!,2.0

"These are THE BEST gummy bears I've ever had. They are soft, moist, and chewy, and don't feel like chewing on a dry peices of wood unlike some other brands.The flavor of every single one is so clearly identifiable, and most of them you can tell are real flavors, and don't just taste like artificial synthetic flavors. the green apple actually taste like apple. The mango actually taste like mango. I cannot get enough of these and it's actually becoming a problem.I highly recommend them 10/10.",5.0
"These have the texture of classic old protein bars. A bit chewy and dense. If you are turned off by that then these might not be for you. However, they have less fat and sugar than almost all other protein bars. You get 20 grams of protein for just 180 calories. That is something most other bars can't match. I also really like this flavor and the chocolate chunks within it.",5.0
"The freshness is very good, but for the price, I really expected something really good. These are probably some of the worst tasting bars I've ever had and way too expensive. Wish I could return them and get my money back",2.0

These bars are great for a quick on the run snack. Also great for a chocolate fix. If you like granola and chocolate then these are perfect. Great flavor and very satisfying. Low on WW points.,5.0
"Yes I‚Äôm a grown man and I still enjoy a granola bar for an afternoon snack. These things are delicious. Moist and chewy with lots of flavor. Probably too much sugar in them but they say fiber one so they must be healthy, right?! Price was same as big box store but they drop it right in my mailbox so what else can you ask for?",5.0
Rather have this since I can no longer chew real fiber and MD does not recommend pills.,5.0

I gave the family pack away after I had sampled one which I almost instantly spit into the waste basket. Not so with the dependable Altoids.  Due to their small size and pretty metal can, I hand them out to friends.  Now, that's fun.",5.0

I find both David's normal seeds and Jumbo seeds to both be consistently excellent.I like salt, and I find David's ""salted"" version to be well salted. I'm happy. However if take makes you worry whether these may be too salty for you, then yeah, you should probably look for the ""lightly salted"" version instead.",5.0

"I wanted Bugles for a cool recipe where you stuff the Bugle with sweetened peanut butter and then dip the end in chocolate.  You can imagine that you need well-formed whole individual Bugles to do this, and buying a bag in the store you never know how crunched up they are going to be.  These individual bags packed inside a box seemed to keep more Bugles in their original pristine condition.  Also. I'm not sure why, but these individual packages seemed to have a higher proportion of well-formed Bugles with a nice opening that did the ones in the large bag from the store.  Your mileage may vary.  I might have been lucky.  But I was pleased with these aspects of this particular Bugles product.",4.0

"I finally gave up trying to buy this locally. It's always out of stock at my local grocery stores for some reason, so I decided to order it here. I'm so glad I did! It arrived quickly and was very fresh. I chew a pack a day, and love how long the flavor of this brand lasts. I will order again soon!",5.0
The flavor lasts a long time....too bad it's a terrible flavor.  I bought this because Extra spearmint was unavailable. This gum is not unlike a timeshare....I can't give it away.,2.0
Great price and the gum is fresh. Glad to have bought it.,5.0
I have been buying this gum for years now. Trident makes the best gum. Some Sam‚Äôs club is out of it I decided to buy it from Amazon. Same price so that‚Äôs good.

"I love these protein bars. In particular, the strawberry and chocolate mint blow my socks off.",5.0
"I recently purchased 2 boxes from Amazon after trying one from my local grocery store. I purchased the mint chocolate flavor. I honestly didn't have my hopes up because I've been disappointed in the past with other protein bars. First of all I didn't expect the bar to be so big. I was expecting a super thin, awkward tasting bar. Boy was I wrong. I love wafer cookies, so the first thing I noticed was how thick the bar was. So many layers. Then the taste was off the charts good. I love mint chocolate chip ice cream, so this satisfied that craving. Also, I ate one half for lunch and the other half for dinner, and was extremely satisfied. I won't be ableto go without these. They are honestly too deliciousüå∫üíê",5.0
The protein chocolate crunch bars are good!,5.0
Bought these because someone said they taste like Girl Scout thin mints when frozen.  So I froze them of course‚Ä¶.they were decent.  Definitely not a Girl Scout thin mint though.  They have a slight aftertaste which isn‚Äôt ideal.,3.0
My son is always looking for protein bars that are healthy and taste good. Some are just overly sweet. These are his favorite bars. His favorite flavor of ice cream is mint chip so he loves this flavor. Highly recommend.,4.0
All the flavors are soooo good though they leave a bit of an aftertaste at times. They can also be a bit messy because they crumble.,4.0

I really loved this gum when I was younger. I couldn't find it in any of the stores near me. It is the same as I remembered.,5.0
"My first disappointment was that the gum was not contained in a box, as described in the listing. My second disappointment came about as I realized upon distribution that there were indeed 11 gum packets and not 12. I ordered these to include in the snack bags for my son‚Äôs little league team and not all children will receive one. Besides the fact that the packaging left the individual packets of gum squished, I am most disappointed that one child will be missing out on a childhood favorite in the baseball community.",3.0

"These are my go two nuts as a rule and I keep them in the refrigerator so they don't spoil. However this last bag had peanuts in it that made me very ill.I eat them as snacks in the evening. I ate a bag of peanuts and woke up about 3 hours later, in the middle of the night feeling very dizzy. When I sat up the room was spinning and I was afraid to even walk.I had diarrhea and projectile vomiting. I was sick for the following six days. I had to cancel our plumber who was to put in a new sink & cabinet because I couldn't have anyone standing between me and the commode!As I said, usually these are very good. It will be awhile before I eat anything but Peanut Butter in a jar!!I threw the whole bag away.",1.0
Great bargain for the price. Well worth it.,5.0
When I bought these they tasted burnt! When I reached out to the lady she talked to me like I was the problem. They tasted really bad like the were burnt. $15-$20 wasted. We are a family that is below the poverty line and when we buy food/snacks especially when the price of food is so high we don't expect it to be bad and then have the people talk to you like you're the problem and you're such an inconvenience to their life when it's their job to answer the claim.,1.0

"I don't like to leave negative reviews...don't remember the last time I did.  But we were so disappointed with this product.  The overload of non-flavored pretzels was going stale, the popcorn was going soft, the Chex cereal bites were not stale, but only the corn ones with a coating had any flavor.  There were only about a Tablespoon each of peanuts and candy coated mini-chocolate pieces in the 14-ounce bag.  The name ""Turtle"" was totally misleading and inappropriate.!",3.0

"I did not like any of these flavors and would have given them 1 star. The flavors were so blah! However, my husband thought they were all good and chose 5 stars.

Order out of date by May 14 2023  that will give me 11 days from May 03 2023 today. Why? I ordered 2 boxes. I am one person. I‚Äôm not sure I want 1 every day for 10 days.,5.0

"They do the job but the ""tablet"" gums are always pretty small. They also tend to have flavor just on the outside and after a few chews the flavor is gone. I prefer the ""stick"" gums because the flavor is within all of the gum. In addition, I can keep the wrapping paper and just wrap the gum into that paper when I want to through it away. With the ""tablet"" gums there is no paper and just the (landfill) plastic.",3.0

"Great gum! As a result of my jaw surgery I had when I was younger, I have large gaps to floss between my teeth. I use this gum after meals to freshen up and remove anything left over. Sure, I should just floss and brush after every meal but sometimes there‚Äôs no time for that. I try to always have some of this gum with me. Flavor is fresh, and it doesn‚Äôt leave you feeling like you‚Äôve just chewed a bunch of sugar. Not to mention, the flavor seems to last more than any other brand of gum I‚Äôve tired.",5.0
I wish the flavor lasted longer. At 30 minutes the mint flavor disappears and its replaced by a very strong petroleum flavor.,3.0

These are too sugary and sweat. This is not a healthy protein snack. It's candied meat.,2.0
"Love these, they are perfect size to have for snacking that way you do not eat an entire BIG bag of them.",5.0

"STARBURST Original Fruit Chews Candy has always been a favorite indulgence of mine. The vibrant colors and mouth-watering flavors make every bite a burst of joy. This 15.6-ounce pouch provides a generous amount of candy to satisfy any sweet tooth. The assortment of flavors, including strawberry, cherry, orange, and lemon, offers a delightful variety that keeps me coming back for more. The chewy texture adds an enjoyable element to the experience. While the candy itself is undeniably delicious, I deduct one star due to the occasional stickiness that can occur. Nonetheless, this product remains a classic and reliable choice for those seeking a fruity and flavorful treat that never fails to put a smile on their face.",4.0

"very little ginger until the end, almost all apple. too sweet. regular gin gins or super strength are much better",2.0
I was a bit skeptical about ordering candy from Amazon and unfortunately I was right. I was expecting the same freshness as buying this candy in store and I was wrong. This one bag arrived hard and without as much of the ginger flavoring as normal. Much have been a defective batch. Won't make the mistake again.,3.0

These were not at all what I was expecting.  Super dry crackers that suck the moisture right out of your mouth and no real flavor.  I expected a better product from this company.  If I want a snack cracker I will just stick with the not so good for you kind.  Your giving up taste and texture for healthy with this one.,1.0

These definitely had the typical flavor of rice flour crackers.  They just were dusted with cheddar.  They weren't bad but they definitely weren't the flavor I was looking for.  My fault for not clicking the ingredients list.  I wanted crackers with the almond flour.  There aren't many in this small box so pay attention to what you need.,3.0

"I was so excited to snack on some snappy crispy gingersnaps when they arrived. I'd ordered them as a cart-filler and a tasty treat to accompany the new season of the Mandalorian.Sadly, these Archway gingersnaps are not at all fresh or crispy. I tore them open without paying much attention to the bag, but I suspect the seal was already broken, possibly in the very rough handling they received when packed if not sooner. They were put in an over-sized box with a very heavy tv mount. If they weren't so stale, they would've been smashed to crumbs. I suppose that's what I get for filling out my order with a food-by-mail product.The cookies are that horrible chewy-hard kind of stale and quite inedible. Food is non-returnable, so huzzah. I just threw my money away. If you're considering ordering these usually satisfying cookies yourself, save your time, money, and frustration: pick them up at your local grocery store because your bag could easily be sitting open in a warehouse fright now growing just as stale and disgusting as mine are.",1.0

"Great tasting granola bars that give you energy for outdoor adventures or even just being on a plane, etc. They are small, light and give you a 'full' feeling and energy for hours.

I have tried a lot of the Fiber One products and for the most part they are ok for a low'ish sugar snack.  They all smell good and have good texture and very little flavor.

"Compared to the Atkins snacks I've been eating these taste terrible. However, the atkins snacks use the artificial sweetener maltitol which does have a sweeter taste and a greater impact on blood sugar. So if you really want to be hard-core on keto or not raising blood sugar, this is a safer choice. But yuck!",3.0
"I really wanted to like these because of the price, nutrition, and convenience.  I saw the bad reviews but I'm not all that picky about protein bars, so  I expected that these wouldn't be great but would be good enough.  I thought they would be perfect to throw in my purse to have a convenient portable snack when needed because the macros are good and this doesn't seem like the kind of bar that would melt easily.  I ate one when I had a long wait for an appointment and didn't like it but thought I'd give it another try before reviewing.  I ate another one and definitely don't like these.  The flavor itself isn't terrible but the bar left a bad aftertaste, which I definitely don't want when I'm out.  Definitely the worst protein bar that I've eaten and I doubt I'll buy it again.  It's too bad because everything else about it is fine - I like the size, the portability, and the nutrition content but I just don't want that aftertaste.",2.0

These Honey Roasted Nuts are fresh and delicious. My husband and I can't stop eating them once we start.,5.0
"These peanuts taste great honestly. But the maltodextrin and/or xanthan gum have horrible side effects on my stomach for me. Gut pain and frequent bowel movements the day after ingesting. If you've got gut issues, I'd stay away from this product.",2.0

"I ordered 2 boxes of snack size Doritos for a party. They arrived on May 5th and the expiration date on them was May 23rd. This is ridiculous. I just looked at a large bag of Doritos that we have at my house and they don‚Äôt expire for a couple months. I didn‚Äôt send the chips back because luckily my party was on May 21st so we squeaked by, but it is still frustrating to it a product that is almost expired when it arrives.",2.0

I remember when nacho cheese doritos had cheese on them. Is powdered cheese that expensive now? Bummer,1.0
delivered May 9- expire May 23rd!! Most chips are good for 3 months out- this is ridiculous- I'm trying to sell these chips ASAP!!!,1.0
I buy these to resell in a small gift shop and it's frustrating when the expiration is only 2 weeks after I purchase them. Other times I get 2.5 months of time. The inconsistency has cost me quite a bit of money in profit loss.,3.0
"I was a little worried about ordering these per other reviews stating only 2 chips in some bags and being expired.  They arrived just fine--and dont expire for 2.5 months.  In the questions, the seller states they guarantee 2 months freshness.  So it was definitely a good experience.",5.0

Not in its original packaging box with expiration date. Several bars are hard and inedible. Disappointed.,3.0
"If you look at the details of this Item it shows a unit count of 48($.56/count) so with 24 in a box you would expect two boxes. .56x48 = $26.88, but you don't receive 48 you only receive 24. Your better off purchasing the single flavor boxes on Amazon that are $7.06 for 12 ($.59/count)",1.0
Omg,5.0
I purchased this thinking I was getting a deal. It's $7 prime for a 12 pack. At $23 for a 24x2 pack which also says 48 in the listing this seems like a great deal!It's not. Someone empties 2 12 packs into an amazon box and marks it up 50%. Complete rip off.These bars are delicious but don't be duped by this listing. Buy the boxed 12 packs. These are loose and not packaged for retail sale.,1.0
My kids love these.  Great tasting snack and pretty healthy.,5.0

These are TOO good lol,5.0
"So one from this bag had larvae in it.  That, I'm not even mad about, it happens with natural products and hard to exclude given they are shelled.  What I really don't understand is that I had to discontinue this last bag since a lot of the pistaccios have a horrible flavor that I can only describe as tasting like mold smells.  Very acrid. The taste was so bad I had multiple trips to the bathroom to spit them out and rinse the taste out of my mouth.  I have found this to a lesser extext in the previous package, but only one time.  This bag it has been multiple.  I'm tossing the remaining 3/4 of the bag.  I'm very dissapointed in the quality and its bad enough to discontinue purchasing this brand altogether.  It's too bad, because when they are good, they're great.  Consistency is very important though.",1.0
ther good,5.0
Have to use plastic knife on some to get open other than that there great taste!,5.0
"This is what i found in the last box i purchased and i figured it was just a strange occurrence; but, this time again, i found that in each pack of nuts there were at least 3 and up to 5 empty shells with no nut inside. The missing nuts were not loose in the package. They simply were not there.  I was paying for empty pistachio shells.  This might occur in a pack here and there - but every single pack in the box?  I like the portion size since it helps control me from eating to many nuts in a sitting; but, I want to get my money's worth.  I will look around for another product. I have purchased these nuts 5 times in the past - usually a couple of boxes at a time and never had this complaint before. The price went up but the amount of nuts i am getting went down. :-(",3.0
I like the snack back for work.,5.0
"Healthy on the go snack. Very good portion size, bordering on too big for a travel snack for one person. But that's not a bad thing!  very yummy and fresh.",5.0
"The bag was only about 2/3 full so I decided to weigh it. These are delicious, but when I pay for a 14oz bag of pistachios, I expect to get a 14oz bag of pistachios.",2.0
But this current bag has hardly any flavoring on them.  It‚Äôs disappointing.,3.0

While these were soft and fresh I was disappointed with the flavors. There was no taste difference in them. All colors tasted the same. Kiddos said rhe same thing. Maybe a bad batch but not sure as I've never tried them before.,3.0
The lifesavers gummies were soft and chewy. I really liked the flavor combinations. They were delivered on time and undamaged.,5.0

"Quaker Oats is too big of a company to have this many bags in a production run ending up underweigt or with as much  ariance in portion size between bags as i observed. Either their bagging equipment or weighing equipment was severely out of whack when my box was produced or they're straight up ripping is off. Numerous bags across all flavors had anywhere from 4-12 rice cakes in them. As soon as I noticed one bag had so few rice cakes, I grabbed others from the box. I could tell from touch that some bags were noticeably empty. I took out my kitchen gram scale, and sure enough the bags that had only a few rice cakes inside were significantly under the noted weight on the packaging.It's bad enough we pay more money today for smaller portion sizes than we did pre-pandemic. I won't stand for being ripped off by Quaker.",2.0
Really great snack to have on hand.  Not too salty or overly messy.,5.0
"Ordered these rice cakes for an easy, somewhat healthy snack (compared to a lot of other options). The portion size is quite small with each bag containing ~10 mini rice cakes. I could get over the portion size but the salt/seasoning is just too much. The caramel ones are good. The cheddar and ranch ones are both crazy salty/overseasoned. Mind you, I tend to think Doritos, Cheeto's, etc. also have way too much seasoning on them so use that for comparison purposes when considering my review. Others may love the flavor-train but it's way more than I prefer. No comment on the Apple & Cinnamon, as I've not tried that one yet. All that aside, what I received was fresh so there's that.",2.0

They are fair. But somehow shipping department thinks it is a good idea to ship via USPS in a bag.,2.0
Pretzels arrived broken into small pieces and definitely don't taste like honey wheat pretzel. I don't think there is any honey on it. Overall poor quality. I wonder if Jeff Pesos would like to eat those for a snackü§î... I guess his answer would be-  thanks but no thanks!,1.0
Not much taste and overpriced.  I would not order again.,2.0

Bland with almost no flavor. Also seemed like they might be a little stale immediately upon opening the sealed bag,2.0
I found these honey wheat pretzels exceptionally dry and lacking any flavor honey or otherwise.  I will not be buying these again .,2.0
I am allergic to gluten and dairy. These taste so good that even my kid was eating them. I‚Äôve not only had these but other products from this company. It‚Äôs all good! Gluten free can get expensive so I only buy one thing at a time to try! These are worth it. I quickly ordered more!,5.0
"I bought these for a friend who has Celiac's and they loved them! Perfect options for people who cannot have gluten, but want a nice premade crunchy chocolate chip cookie.",5.0

These cranberry kind bars are delicious. I started eating kind bars 15 years ago when I began to change my diet in a quest to lose weight. Over an 18 month period and 2 kind bars a day combined with a healthy diet I lost 160 pounds. I still eat 2 bars per day.,5.0

I usually have one of these before a longer afternoon run or in the morning if I don't have time to make breakfast. This blueberry or banana flavors are by far the best flavors. Chewy consistency without sticking to your teeth.,5.0
Love the bars but is it too much to ask NOT to send bars with a few months until pull date.,1.0
"I'm sure this is good for you, but it has the consistency of unbaked dough which I found very unappealing.",2.0
A really nice and relatively healthy and filling snack that also gives some decent protein gains. It's really decently sweet and the chocolate chips make it all so much better. Hoping to get a chance to try some of their other products when I get the chance.,5.0
This is great. I love taking them with me to catch a snack. I must eat very few FODMAPs and these are a great way to catch some protein and not upset my tummy.,5.0
Do NOT buy this product!! I was camping with friends and pulled my bar out of the package to take the last bite and there was a needle embedded in it!!I emailed the company and no response.

These power bars are arriving with an unbearable overly strong Febreze type smell! Until things change‚Ä¶.you should stay away from purchasing these!,1.0
I liked them bc they were free from alot of preservatives. Being a dialysis patient you have 2 watch ur persevatives which raise ur potassium & phosphorus to levels that cause you to be sick.  So theyre worth $1 a piece.,5.0

"So, like many teenage boys in our world today, the teen in my household wanted to try the One Chip Challenge. I was familiar with this challenge beforehand, but knew it was going to intense! I agreed to order it for him, as long as he did the challenge at home and I was present. It was delivered in the package with its own packaging (like pictured), and had instructions or better yet, warnings and educational information about the chip itself. Gloves were included as well. Let me tell you... he didn't last even a minute! He chugged so much milk, that he felt sick a couple days later. YOLO, but even he said he wouldn't do it again haha.

"Once upon a time, I embarked on a snack quest, To devour Ruffles' Variety Pack, I must confess. But little did I know, a perilous fate awaited me, As I indulged in chips, sodium's captive, I would be.First, I savored the Classic Original, oh so divine, But with each salty bite, a warning did align. My taste buds rejoiced, but my poor body did groan, For sodium's grip tightened, turning my gut to stone.Then came Sour Cream and Onion, a tangy affair, I couldn't resist, I ate without a care. But alas, my belly swelled, like a bloated balloon, As sodium's mischief worked, sealing my doom too soon.Cheddar & Sour Cream beckoned, a cheesy delight, But as I gobbled them down, my pants grew tight. Oh, the sodium overload, a villainous crime, My belly expanded, like the sands of time.So heed my warning, dear snack enthusiasts of glee, Ruffles' Variety Pack, enjoy but in the modest decree. For sodium's wrath, a bloated fate it may bestow, Leaving you puffed up, like a Shakespearean tragedy's woe.But fear not, my friends, for in laughter we find release, Let this be a lesson, a reminder to decrease. Indulge in Ruffles' delights, but with caution be wise, Lest you suffer the sodium's wicked surprise!",5.0

"$17.99 for a 12 pack of protein bars is pretty expensive, they taste great & are travel friendly only in ideal temperatures that aren't too warm. The chocolate would melt together.",5.0

The wrapper has remained consistent, but the bar inside is smaller. This last shipment, the bar only occupies 3/4s of the wrapper, whereas 2 years ago, it filled the wrapper.

"These Cheetos taste great.  I don't believe I've ever met anyone who doesn't love Cheetos.  Over the years I've found that many small packaged Cheetos bags are just 1oz, and I run out of Cheetos before I finish my sandwich.  The thing I really like is that these bags have two ounces of Cheetos in them, just right.  They are also very useful to have around if you are taking your kids to the park or zoo.  Each person gets their own bag to enjoy.  They are also great to take along for a hike, a bike ride, or camping, etc.  I really like this package size and I think you will too.  Get some, and get ready to have some orange colored fingers as you enjoy.",5.0

"So one from this bag had larvae in it.  That, I'm not even mad about, it happens with natural products and hard to exclude given they are shelled.  What I really don't understand is that I had to discontinue this last bag since a lot of the pistaccios have a horrible flavor that I can only describe as tasting like mold smells.  Very acrid. The taste was so bad I had multiple trips to the bathroom to spit them out and rinse the taste out of my mouth.  I have found this to a lesser extext in the previous package, but only one time.  This bag it has been multiple.  I'm tossing the remaining 3/4 of the bag.  I'm very dissapointed in the quality and its bad enough to discontinue purchasing this brand altogether.  It's too bad, because when they are good, they're great.  Consistency is very important though.",1.0

"This is what i found in the last box i purchased and i figured it was just a strange occurrence; but, this time again, i found that in each pack of nuts there were at least 3 and up to 5 empty shells with no nut inside. The missing nuts were not loose in the package. They simply were not there.  I was paying for empty pistachio shells.  This might occur in a pack here and there - but every single pack in the box?  I like the portion size since it helps control me from eating to many nuts in a sitting; but, I want to get my money's worth.  I will look around for another product. I have purchased these nuts 5 times in the past - usually a couple of boxes at a time and never had this complaint before. The price went up but the amount of nuts i am getting went down. :-(",3.0

"I was very excited to see these arrive and opened the box immediately for an afternoon snack. I was so disappointed when I unwrapped it! The bar had that older chocolate fading already happening and when I took a bite, it tasted old. My first thought was maybe that one was a fluke so tried a second one. Nope, not fluke. It tasted and looked old as well.I checked on the box and found the the expiration date is only a few weeks away.Very disappointed to receive these this way.

Received product several days ago just noticed that on box it says /exclusively for export. I am in the U.S. My interpenetration is this is not for use in the USA. Why was it shipped to me in Connecticut? Also has 7/23 best by. Still technically in time however it is a box of 44.,1.0

"For starters, the price is pretty fair for consumer level consumption- these days at least. They arrived earlier than expected, basically the next business day- 28 hours after ordering. The box is perfectly intact and all of my delicious Snickers bars in immaculate condition.I‚Äôm not entirely convinced they are meant for the U. S. because the taste of one right out of the box seemed a bit less caramel-y than I‚Äôm used to. But I don‚Äôt care one bit cuz I eat my Snickers frozen, as any true connoisseur of this fine candy should.Frozen- no difference detectable, if there even was one in the first place.I was also wary of a fairly soon expiration date. Nope, all of them (I checked every single one) have the same expiration date of November 2023. No chance one lasts nearly that long.I am more than pleased by this purchase and writing this review is the least I can do in return. I‚Äôm not saying buy them all- just cuz I want more and will definitely reorder. So if you have doubts please hold off- more for me, yo.",5.0
"SNICKERS has been around since I was a kid.  No matter what new candy bars came out we would give them a try but we always came back to SNICKERS.  A favorite then and a favorite now.  At 80, there are few things left that I look forward to doing but grabbing a SNICKERS bar has to be in the top ten.  Very few things in the world can compare.",5.0
"The snickers arrive late and sometimes dont arrive at all and have to be issued a refund and wait for my funds to clear, and worst of all the quality is not fresh they always have white spots and are dried out and become hard, please do a better job and stop giving us the old nearly expired ones.",1.0
I will say the crackers were right broken up. It was not awful though,5.0
"In summary, I like the flavor of the sundried tomato and basil.  Some people don't and that is totally preference.What I really do not like is the price for the quantity that you get and the main reason I won't be buying these again.  I did not have a perspective for the weight listed until I got the box and I was laughing when I pulled it out of the shipping box.  It was so light.  Shame because I like them, but I absolutely hate getting ripped off.  The price for the amount you get is a rip off and in my opinion is taking advantage of people who are looking for more wholesome snacks.  Maybe it is an expensive product to make and the manufacturer is not making a massive profit off each box.  That could be true.  However, that still does not make it worth the money.",3.0
Tasted disgusting,1.0

"These were fresh and crunchy, just like the old days. Was put off by warnings of being stale but not so. Boxes in threes but you can easily use a box cutter to slit the tape so you don't ruin box esthetics if you want to hand out individual boxes if that is your thing. You should know that as a kid in the 60's these always came in threes taped together at the top from the grocery store. It was only at the ball park or Zoo and other vendor places that they were separated.I have missed my crackerjacks, glad I got them back. These came in boxes, not bags, boxes were made to look like the originals, very nice and nostalgic. We will order from this vendor again until we get stale or stuck-together product, but this shipment was perfect! Update: Second order just as fresh as the first! Well done!",5.0

I love the little individual servings of Mott's applesauce. I use my EBT stamps. I wish I had read the full description before I bought this item. It was no fault other than my own. I'm so used to a lot of items today being in their natural juices or no sugars being added I put it in my cart without looking. I had to go with them more expensive brand. Mott's did not offer their brand without sugar for EBT customers. I searched for a long time if I'm wrong maybe someone can let me know.,3.0

"For years I have been a JARRED applesauce guy but came to finally admit I threw out 1/3 of the jar each time because I never finished it.  I turned to the single serving applesauces more than a few years ago and have not wasted a drop of applesauce since.  I am convinced I am saving money too.As for the flavor, etc...... it's Mott's and there is no other brand with the consistency in flavor and freshness. This is as good as applesauce gets without making it yourself..... and you might not be able to beat them then either.Highly recommended product, although it is a high sugar product. Mott's makes a no sugar added applesauce but it's just not the same, overly tart. I eat the sugared version...... I just eat less of it.",5.0
"There was a broken container cup in the box, which the apple sauce spread all over. By the time I opened the box after 4hours after delivery, it was filled with piss ants.  I threw away the busted one and washed the remaining cups.",3.0

These were not at all what I was expecting.  Super dry crackers that suck the moisture right out of your mouth and no real flavor.  I expected a better product from this company.

These definitely had the typical flavor of rice flour crackers.  They just were dusted with cheddar.  They weren't bad but they definitely weren't the flavor I was looking for.  My fault for not clicking the ingredients list.  I wanted crackers with the almond flour.  There aren't many in this small box so pay attention to what you need.,3.0
Super Delicious and healthy. Filling as a small snack also.,5.0

I have enjoyed this snack for several years.  It tastes good for something that won't add to your waistline like other snacks.,5.0
"These are great for snacks or part of a meal. Apple goes with peanut butter (put an apple slice on top), Cheddar goes with Tuna and Caramel is a great snack/dessert.

The flavor is great and they crunch just like a cheese it. I am always marking sure I have these in the house! Give ‚Äòem a try you won‚Äôt be disappointed!,5.0

Actually I only tried this maybe 45 years ago, so my memory isn't too clear on how good it was or not. But, in any case, as far as a caramel popcorn goes, this was very so-so. Double packaging (box and inner bag) makes the amount small than you would think. And some of the popcorn is not coated very well at all. The most disappointing thing I guess, was the ""prize"". Just a piece of paper with information to log on to a website. Really? Give me a break. It's better to not say anything about a ""prize inside"".",3.0

Ordered based off picture being the 1oz BOXES. Upon receiving item it was 24 bags . Does not fit with labels I had made for my son‚Äôs birthday. Product should not be displayed as boxes if not actually a BOX,1.0

They‚Äôre spicy but not in an obnoxious way: more like a slow burn that you don‚Äôt even notice until you‚Äôve finished the first stick. Next thing you know you‚Äôre pounding water but not uncomfortable. It‚Äôs an illidic heat that is just enough to let you know it‚Äôs there, but polite enough to back off and let you live your best life. Mighty tasty.",5.0
"I really enjoy the texture as its a bit on the dry side, and the spice has a nice slow burn. First bite or two not much then here comes the build up. Its never supper hot, but a nice medium. It says to refrigerate after opening, but its usually not around long enough to matter.",5.0

I like that most of the popcorn has the butter distributed evenly throughout the bag, the salt is also distributed evenly, and there aren't a whole lot of unpopped kernels left in the bag after popping. I would say that this one is the best I've tried. I like that the bag holds up really well and the popcorn does not escape from the bag while popping.",5.0

"At first you're like cool,  look how many are in the bag.  After a few minutes you're like oh,  I'd better show down and you put the bag away.  Later that same night you're like,  one handful won't hurt.  The next day you look in the bag and say ""where did they all go? ""  they are that good",5.0

The nuts arrived fresh and in perfect condition, which is a testament to the care and attention to detail that Wonderful Pistachios puts into their products.Overall, I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a delicious and convenient snack option.

"The flavor is great, make no mistake, love the dark chocolate flavor & sweet enough but not overly, just wish it had mire berries; really, very few tiny pieces, so if you do get one it's rather a treat you eat after a bite of the chocolate granola. I mean the 'pieces' are more like little bits. You can taste them (by themselves) but so small they get lost if you get some with your chocolate granola. They are few and far between. SO, Love the dark chocolate balance, good flavor, but as far as the red berries, tasty as those lil bits may be, the need to add more, and make them pieces - bigger (not itty bitty bits its so hard to find them & flavor is lost if not withdrawn.",5.0

"I personally get sick of buying brands that advertise themselves as healthy or high quality and then add cheap filler ingredients to save mere pennies. Why use a brand name like ""Nature's Path"" with fluff words like ""Non-GMO"", and ingredients like ""Cane Sugar"" when the third ingredient--and therefor a big portion of what you are eating--is soy oil.There are so many alternatives and it is known that processed soy causes stomach issues for a lot of us. So why save a couple pennies when you could just as easily have used cottonseed, palm, or any number of alternatives that don't cause issues for so many people. Sadly I won't be buying Love Crunch again because it isn't worth the discomfort it causes to eat it. I can buy my local chains organic brand for less, which uses canola oil and less unnecessary ingredients like ""chocolate flavor"" and ""rice starch"".",1.0

I ordered 5/11/23.I really didn't want another xmas bag for summer, i decided i needed all the red ones to make cookies for 4th of july, then decided I'm really going to do it. I poured the bag of m&ms in a bowl with a teaspoon i separated the red from the green. We're eating the green ones. Since i opened the bag i hope they remain as fresh as they are now for my cookies.I guess they were marked down because of the season. For the price i couldn't resist, now the price even lower, so I'm going to order for an emergency bag, but i fear the expiration date will be the same as this bag.4* because of expiration date.",4.0
"The bag of M&M's was split in two places. When I opened the shipping bag, there were M&M's all over the inside of it. I called to return/refund. I have no idea if the inside of the shipping bag is good grade safe. I wasn't taking any chances. Even if that didn't happen though, the M&M's were turning white, like they were old, even the ones remaining in the M&M bag so I wasn't from the inside of the shipping bag. That was also disturbing. I will not be buying these again.",1.0

But for the value of 8.32 for 38 oz I took a chance.. what do you know,, they were good, and it saved me a lot of money. I did go back to buy another bag,, that price shot up to 10.32,, so who knows why I got a great discount. But at 10 you might as well buy a fresh bag.",5.0

"I have had this product on Subscription for about two years because I love it.  I wait for it to arrive when I've consumed the last packets from the previous month because I really enjoy it. However, recently I have found that one out of every four or five individual packets is stale - as in chewy and very unpalatable.  I actually cringe when I get it in my mouth it's so yucky - for lack of a better word.  I'm not sure why this is happening as the outer wrapper of the 20 packet product seems to be intact and the packets seems to be airtight, as well, before I open them, not to mention there's a silica gel packet in the stale packets just like the fresh, crisp ones.  I am about to look for another source for my seaweed sheets I'm so disappointed.",2.0
Keep getting these. They are delicious.,5.0
"I love these snacks - although I admit i grew up earing seaweed as a snack (we called it dulse). There is not a lot (weight wise) in one package, but that's fine because it makes for a reasonable serving size. Chili lime is the best flavor - although that's not included in this variety pack. Teriyaki is probably the best in this variety pack, followed by wasabi. The others are a little bland.",4.0
The product is wonderful. The overdone packaging is awful for the environment.,5.0

In a box I will usually find 2-3 bags that are either open or missing most of the chips so quality control is a little off.

"Quaker Oats is too big of a company to have this many bags in a production run ending up underweight or with as much  variance in portion size between bags as I observed. Either their bagging equipment or weighing equipment was severely out of whack when my box was produced or they're straight up ripping is off. Numerous bags across all flavors had anywhere from 4-12 rice cakes in them. As soon as I noticed one bag had so few rice cakes, I grabbed others from the box. I could tell from touch that some bags were noticeably empty. I took out my kitchen gram scale, and sure enough the bags that had only a few rice cakes inside were significantly under the noted weight on the packaging.It's bad enough we pay more money today for smaller portion sizes than we did pre-pandemic.

The information for the 40g bag is in the last column which is normally reserved for the calories in the whole container, making it appear that there are only 200 calories per bag. Intentional?

Excellent low calorie snack and they are delicious! Trying to lose weight and this is a great snack option over potato chips. We ate the entire box within a week or so. Will purchase again.,5.0
Variety pack is perfect for the entire family. Healthier then most snacks & good. Works for us!,5.0
I love this gum and buy it in bulk on Amazon  and it‚Äôs so handy. I keep one in my car and sometimes give out with gifts. I love the flavor too.,5.0
"Smack you in the face flavor initially, lasts longer than most gums.",5.0
I love this gum for that the flavor is lasting and doesn't get soggy quick. I really really really be chewing and this is the longest one yet.,5.0
"The product is fine. The gum tastes good, but there are only 4 packs, so ignore the false advertising of 6 bottles in the main picture. Just offering a heads up in case you miss that at the VERY END in parenthesis of the description.",3.0
My wife and I love this gum; great taste and the flavor is long lasting,5.0
It was freshening.,4.0
I love this gum. It lasts about 2 hrs. And it has great packaging. I do recommend this gum,5.0
At about $5.00 for 50 pieces these are less expensive and just as good as Velamints (from Trader Joes).  You can get them in recyclable plastic tubes or the newer cardboard containers made mostly of recycled material.  They have a good mastic that holds it's flavor and it's chewiness for a long time.,5.0
"When you don't have time to brush your teeth after a meal, this is a perfect palate cleanser!",5.0
"I love the flavor (spearmint) but after chewing make sure you do not place on anything other thanpaper towel, plate...etc",3.0
Mostly peanuts but a few different nuts. If it‚Äôs. I salt you want works great.,3.0
"We just wanted to find a nutritious snack but it needed to have no salt. These were Planter‚Äôs usual great quality, roasted without salt. So good! Could only find them in Amazon.",5.0
"Mostly peanuts and almonds and really 1 Brazil nut , LOL",3.0
"I had to go on very limited special diet so thought these nuts would help fulfill my protein needs.  I know that peanuts was listed first but was very disappointed that each can only contain about a dozen cashew, and 2-3 Brazil nuts and pecans.  Not worth the the extra price for mixed nuts that were 98% peanuts.",1.0

"They may not call them keep fresh snack packs but I sure do. You know how when you open a set of crackers and then you just kind of twist the top down to help keep them fresh because you don't feel like putting them in a Ziploc bag. Well you don't have to worry about it with this. It's smaller packages of Ritz crackers so that you're probably more likely to finish those in one setting or two and not end up with stale crackers because you didn't close the wrapper down. Oh and their Ritz crackers they're wonderful, they have a wonderful buttery texture and I love them",5.0
Love the small packages.  With the big packages the crackers can become stale if left open,5.0
"This product we love it, we eat it with jelly and sometimes with ham and cheez",5.0
"As a California guy, I always have a pack of RITZ Fresh Stacks Original Crackers in my backpack. One day, I was hiking with my friends and we needed a quick snack. I pulled out the RITZ Fresh Stacks and my friends were amazed at how fresh and crispy they were even after being in my backpack for hours.Pros:The Fresh Stacks packaging keeps the crackers fresh and crispyThe crackers are perfect for on-the-go snackingThe Original flavor is a classic and goes well with any toppings or dipsCons:The crackers can be a bit salty for someThe packaging can be hard to open for some peopleComparison: Compared to other similar crackers in the market, RITZ Fresh Stacks Original Crackers stand out for their freshness and convenience. Other brands may have similar flavors, but the Fresh Stacks packaging ensures that the crackers stay fresh for longer.Delivery: RITZ Fresh Stacks Original Crackers are available for fast delivery through various online retailers.In conclusion, RITZ Fresh Stacks Original Crackers are a snack that delivers on freshness, convenience, and taste. As a California guy, I highly recommend them for any on-the-go snacking needs.",5.0
"Love how neatly packaged they are, none were broken and very fresh.",5.0
These are a perfect accompaniment to the individual peanut butter cups. They're easy to pack for our children.,5.0
Grew up with the Ritz and I had no idea that five crackers was a serving which would be 90 cal. I like the smaller packages because then I don‚Äôt eat the full size package with my soup. However there are recipes that can be found to make nutritious crackers that are very easy. I‚Äôll keep buying this product until I make my own crackers. Everything was perfect with this delivery. By the way I‚Äôve gained 10 pounds so if you‚Äôre looking for a little extra weight have some crackers,3.0
Love these. Also making the pkg. With less crackers in it. One does not waste them. I can eat these day with some cheese.  Will be ordering more.,5.0
"Love the smaller packs, they definitely help keep the crackers fresh. Delicious!Recommend",5.0
Someone did not pack all the boxes that were to be included with the shipment.  I got one pack of 4 rolls of crackers.  There were to be a six pack of them and only one pack arrived in the box.,1.0
Bought these to surprise my wife. She said they were DELICIOUS!,4.0
Huge strawberries and they are so tasty. The box branding is on point and they'd make a lovely gift. My biggest complaint is that the box is huge for what you actually get inside and it honestly just feels so wasteful. So much trash for a dozen strawberries.,4.0
I‚Äôd ordered from here before and was very pleased but this time the berries arrived past peak with the stems already turning brown. One bite into the berry and you get that tangy taste of a berry gone bad. These were a surprise for my 25th wedding anniversary. Very disappointed and not sure how to return.,2.0
They arrived 1 day earlier than expected which was great but they were melted and not very pretty at all.,1.0
I've ordered these in the past so I was very disappointed to find that the strawberries were not as good as before. The shipping was late by a day but the package was sealed to keep them cool.  They were a gift for my wife for mother's day. Unfortunately about half of them were sour and starting to spoil.  Will not order again.,1.0
Packaging was fine Berries horrific at best.embarrassed to send to mom,1.0

"Being that these were for Mother‚Äôs Day‚Ä¶..ended up being a terrible gift. Not only did they arrive melted - the berries are old.Personally, would like my money back",1.0
Product arrived hot and nasty,1.0
The box of chocolate covered strawberries were not good. The chocolate was intact upon receipt but the strawberries were too ripe - you could tell they were probably a week past their prime. Not too thrilled for a Mother‚Äôs Day gift.,2.0
It was smaller than expected. The candy wasn't very good. Didn't eat most of it. Just wasn't pleasant taste.,1.0
Says Happy Birthday on every box! Can't give on Mothers day. The meltaway candies were stale.  The popcorn mix was unedible. Creme brulee nuts were 95% peanuts. Save your money. Wish we had.,3.0
It was a gift for my Mother-in-Law... So I don't have a way to answer it. She was the recipient. She didn't say it wasn't good.,5.0

"I ordered this for my grandson yesterday as a last minute Easter. When I ordered several said Happy Birthday and I specifically chose one that had ‚Äúeaster‚Äù and ‚Äú spring‚Äù in the description. It shows up and has Happy Birthday. Disappointing and even though they laughed it appeared to me as a thoughtless gift. They seemed ok with the contents, I could not get past the holiday theme.",2.0
I sent this to my sister for her birthday. She loved both the packaging and the contents.,5.0
They enjoyed the gift,5.0
I have purchased 3 of these for gifts! Everyone loved it! The best part was that my Granddaughter felt special receiving it on her Birthday in front of all her friends! Highly recommend!,5.0

"One day our children's children won't believe that our society used to be so advanced that we could order Sausage Snack Sticks from our phones while watching a 007 movie and have them show up on our shady porch within 24 hours. I barely believe it myself, but here we are.These sticks last a long time.  I leave them in the fridge for a month or two as I use them, and they do great. They are dry enough to put directly into your pocket if you need to.  Since Costco stopped carrying them for a while, Amazam came in clutch.",5.0
I never ate this product.  I gave it too my neighbor unopened after realizing it contains mammals  most people who go out of their way to purchase pricier bird or fish products do so because they don't eat mammals,1.0
"Everytime I order there is a chance I don't get this flavor, didn't this time or last. We like both flavors regular is a bit spicy and honey sugar is my daughter's and wives favorites. I always eat it and never like to complain,but this order was for vacation and I was expecting what I ordered, I know right lol. Please fix this if I order regular or honey that's what I want I got enough regular flavor and I can't eat it fast enough and threw at least half a package I wouldn't have if it arrived an accurate order.",3.0

Love this trail mix. It‚Äôs sweet AND SPICY and addictive!!,5.0
The Happy Belly Sweet & Spicy Trail Mix made my belly and taste buds very happy. The flavor is very tasty and the product was fresh. You mostly get the spice and every now and then a slightly sweet bite. I already have two more bags in my cart. Yummy!,5.0
Taste great. Mixture of flavor. Good price.,5.0
"I ordered this mix twice and loved it. Then I ordered a third time and the package says ""happy belly"" instead of Amazon, and is so spicy I honestly can't eat it. I liked the Amazon one a lot, and ordered the same thing each time, this one is just different",3.0
"I usually am the biggest fan of this trail mix, but the last two orders I received were overly seasoned, so much that I couldn‚Äôt enjoy it.",2.0
This mix has an amazing flavor. Sweet and spicy.,5.0
Review is for shipment. Don‚Äôt buy ahead thinking you‚Äôre gonna be able to make these last over a period of time. Ordered and received in June and it expires in August of the same year. Disappointed in expiration date. You already know how delicious these are. I don‚Äôt need to tell you.,4.0

"It was nice to get all of them in one box, but many of them were stale.  They were tossed in a box, not an original box that they normally come in.",3.0

Cookies were hard and tasteless‚Ä¶.,2.0
"One of the cookie bags was open/not properly sealed, received only 17 baggies instead of 20, and one of the chips o'hoy bags seemed like it had double the amount of cookies than the others. The box itself was closed and seemed untampered with, but just strange and made me doubt if someone tampered with the baggies somehow. You never know nowadays... Luckily received a full refund.",1.0
Product was ok but box came quite damaged.,4.0

"I buy these from the Gas Station all the time, and they are my Favorite. I thought this 9-pack was a great deal, so I bought them.These bags have SO many rotten and bad seeds inside - I cannot eat them. Amazon is Saying this is a ""non returnable"" item -  NO wonder they are selling them CHeap on Amazon - these must be the rejectsI am 100% serious - my shipment was terrible. I just bought more from the Circle K near me, and they are great. What a Rip-off/Scam",1.0
Love this brandThey‚Äôre not too salty just how I like it,1.0

Absolutely delicious! Just the right amount of sweet and salt. Good price too!  (Just don't buy the cheesy version!! It is so salty and the cheese flavor is nasty! ),5.0

This was a very reasonable priced snack,5.0

THEY WERE STALE IN THE BOX WHEN RECIEVED AND COULD NOT FILE FOR REPLACEMENT,1.0
"I bought these for my husband as a healthier alternative to candy bars and cookies. He ate a few but said most of them are going stale or are already stale‚Ä¶. Won‚Äôt be buying these again. Thought I‚Äôd get him a variety,since all we can find is the plain/regular ones. Never mind. Wont make that mistake again.",3.0
"Really wish there where more peanut butter and chocoate then plain, but its granola bars you know what you bought :)",5.0
"These are ok for a quick snack normally, unfortunately as I get through the box, there is too much crumbles/ broken bars, The box itself wasn't damaged so I don't get it, if I new they would be like this then I definitely wouldn't have bought them",3.0
Product is great - Unfortunately -when you ship a box of fragile items in an envelope - they get crushed - every individually packed bar is smashed.,3.0

It said it was 50% or less of peanuts I think they should‚Äôve said it was 75% peanuts. There must‚Äôve been only five pecan pieces and maybe 10 cashews planters. Should be ashamed,1.0
"I went to reorder the Deluxe Mixed Nuts my family and I like, and I saw that the Lightly Salted option was less expensive (and we actually prefer lightly salted). However, when we received them today, they are several nuts included that we do not like (and one that my husband cannot eat). I was confused about what happened, and looked back at the order. Apparently, the ""lightly salted"" option is an entirely different assortment of nuts. This is misleading on the web page. Since they are food items, they are not eligible for return, and I could not find a resolution by calling or chatting. I guess we will just have to find someone to gift these to as we won't be eating them. Just be warned that the website is misleading before purchasing.",2.0

don't chew too much or this gum will act as a laxitive!!,5.0
"The reviews are overwhelmingly positive so I assumed this would be a high quality gum. Seems like it is more natural than most other gums but I'm truly surprised at the taste. I got the spearmint, and for the first few chews it literally tastes like sunscreen and then morphs into a weird spearmint flavor... for like a minute. Disappointed.",2.0
You get what you pay,1.0
Taste good happy with my purchase,5.0
Sucralose/Splenda and aspartame give me migraines so I had to find a gum that had neither - this is good stuff and I keep packs all over. Just don‚Äôt let your pet near them,5.0
Chocolate mint sucks but all the other flavors are great,4.0
This should be marketed as trick gum since the flavor decreases sharply with each chew. One minute is the max a piece of this gum can be chewed before spitting it out. It tastes like wax after the flavor leaves. I had cinnamon flavor.,1.0
"I ordered four boxes of this product and they didn‚Äôt come in on the expected date. I actually forgot about the delivery. They eventually came in but were somewhat stale. They are still edible, but not really fresh. I‚Äôll just get them at the store next time.",2.0

Very generous on nuts at this price. Just be sure to shake it up or you might think it's all cranberries at first. The nuts settle.,5.0
I really liked the Happy Belly Cranberry & Nuts Trail Mix but the last two or three bags have been filled with mostly cranberries. You have to hunt for the nuts & at over $15 per bag this is just unacceptable. I buy a lot from Amazon but this product has become a disappointment.,2.0

When I received my order the candy bag was opened and candy was missing.,1.0
The last batch of these I purchased were hard and felt like my teeth were going to break off. This is not normally the case.I like the ingredients in here for a more natural processed snack. The flavor is good and the nuts have enough fat and protein to keep you energized for a while. The chocolate on the back/bottom makes you feel like you‚Äôre giving yourself a treat as well.,3.0
They we're close to expiration date so probably why they were on special price and kind of hard to chew. You really had to work at it,3.0

"Usually annie's are the best imo, I have not ordered the sea salt in awhile because of the price increase. I ordered a 12 pk of both Sea Salt and Sesame this time,  the Sesame are fine. Unfortunately the Sea salt flavor ones were almost rubbery (hard to bite apart) and tasteless... with an expiration date of August, they were horrible, possible badly stored? Quality always seems to fluctuate with this flavor.",1.0

"I for some reason was thinking these would have more of a chip like texture, or be thicker. But they‚Äôre paper thin and crumbly and do not make a good snack. I‚Äôm really upset I wasted the money on these as they won‚Äôt be eaten & they were expensive.",1.0

They were good but they weren't Very Fresh or soft.,3.0
This bag is maybe a $1 item at the store. Look at the other reviews. This is not a good value for $6. You maybe will get 20 pieces of stale candy. Don‚Äôt drink and prime ladies and gentlemen,1.0

Almonds have always been my favorite nut because of the delicate wonderful flavor. Found that this brand of organic almonds lacked that special flavor.

This stuff is amazing ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs only green and hour of chewing and I feel on my way to having the jawline of GIGA-CHAD!,5.0
Followed the instructions and it still felt like I had super glue in my teeth. Took several hours to get it out of my teeth and there's still a residue coating my teeth. This has to be the absolutely worst product sold on Amazon and you can't even return it so it's pretty much a huge scam.,1.0
This gum will do as advertised and tone up your face but the issue is it gets stuck in your teeth bad and will require a pick to clean. So if you‚Äôre into excessive dental care following a chew then this product is for you.,2.0
"I just received it, chewed it in my mouth for 10 minutes, I just tried it for the first time and I don‚Äôt feel any effect yet, but I understand that in order for there to be changes, you need to chew for several days, well, I‚Äôll try",2.0

Leaves a weird taste in your mouth and melts on teeth and you have to keep it in a certain temperature or it will melt in the bag,1.0
"The taste is great - little altoids that pack a punch. Each tin box came concealed in clear plastic wrapping but when taking off the wrapping, the tin box was sticky and white speckled. Most likely the mint particles that came through the tiny holes of the tin box. That would be my only complaint.",4.0
Perfect size for your pocket. I keep one in the car too.,5.0
These are the minis but they pack a punch to knock out bad breath!,5.0
I have a conspiracy theory that mint companies specifically design their products to be chewable because they want us to just eat the whole tin in one sitting. I‚Äôm not going to allow this to stand any longer.Mints deserve to linger and one mint should saturate your senses. These tiny mints aren‚Äôt good enough. You need at least 2 to be satisfied and they‚Äôre too easy to chew on and eat like candy.Fix your mints.,1.0
I use Altoids peppermints to calm an irritated throat.  The small mints are just the right size for this purpose.  I find the regular size mints leave an aftertaste.,5.0
"Always carry a tin in my purse, you never knowwhen your breath isn‚Äôt fresh. Love the peppermintflavor.",5.0
Great product for good value with good delivery service.,5.0
"Many years ago, I spent a year in England for work. I got addicted to the original Altoids. Not only did they take care of bad breath, but they also cleared the sinuses!!! Sadly, they also caused severe tooth decay (and may I add that getting dental care in the UK was a tad difficult).I've tried so many sugar free mint options, but none of them had the same punch that Altoids did. Until I discovered these! Do they taste as good as the original? Not really, but they do have the same strong mint kick. I also like that they're so tiny...the container (it's great to be able to put the tin in a pocket) and the actual mints. No need for overkill!Only one negative. These come in a plastic sleeve, and each tin is also wrapped in plastic. Once you get the second wrap off, there is always a lot of sticky, minty powder. You'll need to wipe that off before use. Heads up...don't touch your eyes when you have any of the powder on your hands!",4.0

My favorite chip and nice in these portion controlled bags.  Otherwise I cant stop eating them. Nicely salted - not oversalted.,5.0

"Highly recommend this triple variety pack of Cape Cod kettle cooked chips.  They arrived in great packaging, on time and have a fresh flavor.  Great to grab as a quick snack out the door.",5.0
I would prefer choosing a single flavor. Portion control is fantastic.  They arrive fresh.  Most of the time the box arrives undamaged.,4.0
The last batch of these I purchased were hard and felt like my teeth were going to break off. This is not normally the case.I like the ingredients in here for a more natural processed snack. The flavor is good and the nuts have enough fat and protein to keep you energized for a while. The chocolate on the back/bottom makes you feel like you‚Äôre giving yourself a treat as well.,3.0
They we're close to expiration date so probably why they were on special price and kind of hard to chew. You really had to work at it,3.0

Love these cookies. Great taste not bitter or too strong. Amazon please instruct your package handlers that a cookie box needs a box for shipping.

"Others have left reviews saying this item arrived damaged from Amazon. I ordered it from prime in May 2023, & it arrived completely surrounded in bubble wrap, in a box with a half dozen other items, & it was intact.As far as the cheese... it's mild with extra mild. I've tried a few diff cheese salsas recently, just out of curiosity. This Pace mild with Jalape√±o flavor does not taste very jalape√±o at all.  It tastes kinda like cheese whiz from a can, watered down & then thickened up, with a slight tangy flavor.Everyone has their own preferred tastes, so ymmv of course. I think I'll stick to the big brand, medium flavored salsas & cheese salsas that I always have. I'm leaving this review with 4 stars, 2 for the flavor of the item, & 2 for the packaging Amazon sent it in, so it arrived in perfect condition.",4.0

I have tried a lot of the Fiber One products and for the most part they are ok for a low'ish sugar snack.  They all smell good and have good texture and very little flavor.  It keeps me from eating something worse so I'm not complaining lol. This is the first flavor I tried that I couldn't finish the box.  Try a different flavor.,2.0
"Compared to the Atkins snacks I've been eating these taste terrible. However, the atkins snacks use the artificial sweetener maltitol which does have a sweeter taste and a greater impact on blood sugar. So if you really want to be hard-core on keto or not raising blood sugar, this is a safer choice. But yuck!",3.0
"I really wanted to like these because of the price, nutrition, and convenience.  I saw the bad reviews but I'm not all that picky about protein bars, so  I expected that these wouldn't be great but would be good enough.  I thought they would be perfect to throw in my purse to have a convenient portable snack when needed because the macros are good and this doesn't seem like the kind of bar that would melt easily.  I ate one when I had a long wait for an appointment and didn't like it but thought I'd give it another try before reviewing.  I ate another one and definitely don't like these.  The flavor itself isn't terrible but the bar left a bad aftertaste, which I definitely don't want when I'm out.  Definitely the worst protein bar that I've eaten and I doubt I'll buy it again.  It's too bad because everything else about it is fine - I like the size, the portability, and the nutrition content but I just don't want that aftertaste.",2.0

I buy these regularly now. I don't really like eating too much in the mornings. So bars gave always been my thing. I am also lactose intolerant so I'm limited to which bars I can eat. I have tried a multitude of brands. Vegan and dairy free. Some being too chalky. Others too gummy. Or dry. These are probably the best bars I've had. They are a bit higher but worth it. I also order direct from macro when they offer discounts.The flavors are pretty great. But what I appreciate most is the texture. And the consistency. It's not like a dry bready nut bar dipped in chocolate. Or a Rice Krispy feelin chocolate dipped sugary whatever bar... It's a consistently made bar. So every bite is the same. Not too dry. Not too gummy. Very well made. I'm a fan,5.0

"This is some of the best ‚Äúlight‚Äù popcorn I ever had. The popcorn taste is all there with a hint of salt. Not too much, and not too little!

"Seeds added to bread dough are both healthy and filling, make the bread chewy, although a few times I find myself chewing on minute gritty bits that had been either mixed in or not removed. It makes me wonder if any of these bulk seeds had been stored on the concrete floor like grains I have watched on TV.Convenient mix all in one package. I reduced the heavy concentration of flax by adding other seeds that I purchased separately.",4.0

"I suffer from chronic dry mouth and I was hoping this gum would help. The gum simply has a sour and tangy flavor that makes your mouth water alot when you first start chewing it. Once that is all out of the gum which is a few minutes, it just makes your mouth more dry than it was. It does have good flavor but only lasts a few minutes as well.  You are better off having a bottle of water instead.",1.0
Tart and fruity gumReminds me of original Gatorade gum flavors,4.0

My goal is to counteract dry mouth when I'm out for a run, and these three colors work totally effectively.  But the Purple ones disintegrate into a powder-like substance, are ineffective, and result in a tiny, hard mass.  Again, the other three colors are totally fine.  Not sure what happened to Purple.",4.0

"I absolutely love cinnamon bears and cannot get enough of them!  I have purchased these 5 pound bags several times now but for some reason the package I received this time was even better than before.  These bears are just the perfect amount of cinnamon making them not too hot to enjoy.  The are extremely soft and almost melt in your mouth.  They do not stick to your teeth which can be very annoying.Overall, if you are looking for the perfect cinnamon bear at a good price I would highly recommend these.",5.0
They are good,5.0

"Love the flavor, not too sweet or hot, perfect amount of both. Texture is also great, not too hard of soft. I‚Äôd buy again, they‚Äôre yummy.",5.0
"I can say I‚Äôve had a lot better and worse than these, they are kind of hard as in very chewy and the taste is uhhh ok, I guess for the price they are maybe on par, they are decent enough but would i spend another $20 on them?

Worst quality popcorn ever,1.0
I‚Äôm a huge popcorn enthusiast and remember before the internet that I wished I could find somewhere to order the mushroom popcorn I saw being used at my local farmers market. I don‚Äôt know why it took me so long to get this but I‚Äôm so glad I did. Perfect popcorn in my Whirly Pop in about 3 minutes. I usually make kettle corn. Just make sure your oil is smoking or at least 400 degrees BEFORE putting the kernels in. Not sure why I knew this going in but I‚Äôm sure glad I did. Almost every kernel pops in every batch I‚Äôve made from batch #1.,5.0
"I ordered another brand from the amish and was super sad at the results. But I really love truffle popcorn so I went for this brand. These turned out terrific. Large kernels and fluffy popcorn results. I made a batch to start off my day, today. Excited for company to come over so I can make them a little snack. FINALLY! A tasty brand I can stick with.",5.0
"This product was listed as ‚Äúmushroom‚Äù kernels, but they are not. It is simply yellow popcorn, with 95% ‚Äúsnowflake‚Äù kernels. Yes, it pops large kernels, but the shape and texture is not what was described in the product listing. Will not reorder.",1.0
"Right when I opened it, I noticed that the package labelling was different than the amazon page. The ""Perfect Pop"" brand was the same but it did not say ""mushroom popcorn"" which was what I was looking for. I gave it a shot, and it popped exactly like the normal bulk popcorn kernels that I can but for 1/4 of the price. Getting a refund for this bait-and-switch.",2.0

Got theses for a friend whose grandson loves them. She shouldn't find them anywhere. So this is a perfect gift.,5.0
"Bought these hundreds of times over the years but for some reason, Amazon's Ranch Flavored sunflower seeds are not the same as the convenience stores.  It's possible Davids sends a lesser quality to Amazon. There is no ranch flavor, just extreme salt, nearly double the salt you'd get with their original (which I've ordered 7x on Amazon without any taste differences). Maybe these are expired or a bad batch?",2.0

It makes so much more than needed so I sacrificed some of the rice from the egg/tuna sushi to make the roe sushi bigger.

Sometimes you'll get a crunchy peanut, sometimes a gooey caramel, but every time it's a delightful surprise.Eating these M&Ms is like ""floating in space"" because the chocolatey goodness is out of this world. And when you're done with one handful, you'll be like ""I'll be back"" for more.

"If I'm driving any real distance, I'm entitled to one of these bags.  Normally I'd get them at the Membership store of my choice, currently BJs.  But one day I checked online and there was a better price here.  Who knew?M&Ms are subject to the perfectly valid objection that there is only one M. They're Ms unless you eat two at once consistently but don't or they'll just be mmmmms.  Eat them one at a time, chew off the candy coating after it melts a bit, then let the chocolate melt in your mouth as God intended.  Well, God and the confectioner.  If you drink anything cold, wait a bit because these melt best at body temperature not a few degrees colder.But they're extremely good, and for me these are the one candy that I like a lot but can still keep in the house at all times without constantly indulging.  Literally, all times.  If I'm nearly out I buy more.  It's been a decade since I last ran out.Oh, it's time to drive.",5.0

It comes in the same tin as the others. It'd be nice if they redesigned it so you could dispense one at a time. This way if you are sharing, peoples fingers get all over the other mints. Not ideal. Plus the lid doesn't always close shut so some can spill out.",4.0

"I loved these candies! They came in perfect condition (not stale, crumbled or melted), and the flavor is delicious. Definitely taste the guava. Sweet and slightly tart. Only complaint, which is minimal, is that when you open the bag there is a very strong chemical smell - I'm thinking it's from the plastic bag packaging. But I took the candies out (theyre individually wrapped) and put them in a large ziploc bag and that got rid of the smell. The candy is a little hard, so if you're a chewer, it might be rough on your teeth lol.",4.0

The thing I really like is that these bags have two ounces of Cheetos in them, just right.  They are also very useful to have around if you are taking your kids to the park or zoo.  Each person gets their own bag to enjoy.  They are also great to take along for a hike, a bike ride, or camping, etc.  I really like this package size and I think you will too.

I just wanted something to have fun with since I still like gumballs (I am 59 years old). I don't have kids and find a strange satisfaction turning the crank and hearing the coin drop into the machine and little gumball dispensed. After the gumballs run out I am trying M&Ms! It is almost all cast iron like it says but the bank is plastic underneath. Not an issue since it is only for home use. It is easy to fill and that is real glass as well. I love that!

"My granddaughter loves this gumball machine. I made her a little jar of coins where she can get the money to get the gumballs out. It works with any type of coin, doesn't have to be a quarter and once compartment is full it can be emptied. There is a setting where you can access the gumballs without payment but that is half the fun for my granddaughter so we kept it.I wish it would have come with gumballs but they needed to be ordered separately. Great product!",5.0
Gifted this to my nephews and the loved it. They use it everyday. filled it with gumballs.,5.0
This is a sturdy well made beautiful gum all machine- however it is a waste of money because the gears inside the machine do not function properly even w the correct size gum balls. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt use it and discover quick enough to return it so now we‚Äôre stuck w a gum ball machine that doesn‚Äôt work. :-/,2.0
I filled this with peanut m&ms and I love it. You only get one or maybe two at a time.  My chocolate lovers want more than one at a time. I misplaced instructions to use it without coins. Can anybody be tell me how to switch it to dispense without coins?,5.0
Great gumball machine. Very sturdy,5.0
"Works well, we put any coin in and it dispenses 2 or 3 m&ms, which is just about right for kiddos.",5.0
"Despite the 17 stickers covering the glass, this gum ball machine has stood tall against my 6 year old. It works with both the larger gum balls and the smaller ones.  The coin collector holds tons of change - which is awesome too. It‚Äôs easy to come apart and refill or clean.",5.0
"First, the handle that turns is finicky.  Sometimes, it won't turn all the way, and the bubble gum doesn't drop through to the tray.  Then, my daughter gently shook the gumball machine and one of the gumballs broke the glass globe.  FYI, the glass globe is made of really thin glass.  It's very fragile.  Plus, this item is NOT returnable.  I don't recommend this product.",1.0

I recently served these in a family gathering and they were a complete embarrassment. I can only assume the people at Planter's never sampled them or simply didn't care and put out anyway. No one should be putting these in their mouth. They are that bad.,1.0

"said whole chashews, well more like all just peices. Bad really bad",1.0
"I have purchased this product in the past and never had issue. However, this time I was not as pleased.Many of the cashews were very dried out to the point they were almost rock hard.

"Love the different flavors - my fave is ""Everything"".

"The lack of salt really affects flavor. I would say if you need a low salt option these are perfect; but if not you may want to look elsewhere. Of note, the seed quality is excellent.",4.0
"horrible, waste of time and money",1.0
These seeds are super dull in the flavor department and the seed itself is much too soft for my taste. I like a seed that is more firm and feels fresh. The best way I can describe these is that they almost seem stale and under seasoned. Gave 2 stars instead of 1 because I didn‚Äôt try all the flavors. But in all honesty these are trash and I would never buy them again.,2.0
The only thing I found was the pep-o-mint flavor wasnt as strong as it usually is. Delivery was quick- packing was excellent!,5.0

"I have not had a chance to a side-by-side comparison to the name brand cookies, but these are either as good as or better than the most popular brand out there. They are sweet and chocolatey, and I am ashamed to admit that my husband and I ended up eating the whole package in one day!",5.0
Almost as good as Oreo but arrived with broken cookies on the ends,4.0
"Very very good taste, texture, flavor!",5.0
"I've been trying various Amazon brand products, since they're often cheaper than the national brands, and finally got to these Oreo ripoffs.  I haven't eaten an Oreo for a couple of years, so I don't know the current state of Oreos as far as quality goes.  But these are pretty good.  These taste almost exactly like regular Oreos and the texture and crunch are the same.  The only criticism I have with these is that they could use a little more cream filling.  From memory alone, I think the brand name Oreos have a bit more, which make them slightly better than these.  But these were much better than I expected and maybe regular Oreos aficionados won't notice.  The only other negative I can think of is that it is quite easy to just open a package of these and just start shoveling them into your mouth until you find none left.  So yeah, these are very good and now I must try other Amazon cookies.  Try them.  If you love Oreos (and only commies don't), I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.  In fact, I think you'll be delighted.  Pleasantly delighted.  Yep, not too shabby...",5.0
I was pleasantly impressed by the flavor‚Ä¶ not the filling is quite thin‚Ä¶,4.0

Been on a pretty strict focusing on ketovore low carb type of diet for approximately three weeks.  Some days I had one of these chocolate bars and maybe a different keto treat at night either after my meal or in between.  It satisfied that craving for sweets and helps to break up the monotony.  The bar is also pretty big so when I‚Äôm experiencing some stronger self control I can even have a quarter size piece and be satisfied.  Pretty nice and I lost 10 pounds.  Slim fast keto products are pretty good!  I also have tried the keto shake and the keto peanut butter bar.  Thumbs up!,5.0

"The Act II light butter can't be beat when it comes to low fat and great taste.  I have tried all of the other brands and always come back to Act II light butter.However, I suggest shopping around.  I purchased this exact popcorn today (May-2023) for $3.59 for a box of 6 bags which is about half of what I would be paying here.  Not a clearance price, not on sale, just the regular price.  I have purchased this mega-pack of 36 bags here on Amazon 24 times... but that was back when the price was competitive.",5.0

"So, I've eaten this forever I love it. I think I must eat two or three bags a day that can't be a good thing because I cracked a few teeth. It cost me a lot of money in caps and bridges. As a result, sadly, I had to switch to OR kettle corn, which I was shocked to discover, at least, for me, or virtually hull less.  I miss this brand better, but what are you going to do?  The switch has been good in one respect -- it's hard to find this in the pantry size and not at all in the 32 bags, unless you're willing to buy it for $99!!",5.0
They taste very good so that‚Äôs why I ordered some. Yummy!! Thank you! üòäüëç,5.0
These peanut butter wafer bars are super delicious but the price tag for a box that has only 5 bars in it is so ridiculously high that I finally stopped buying them.  I could easily eat 5 bars in a day since that was all I was eating!  Will not buy anymore due to the ridiculous price!,5.0

"I‚Äôm really picker. I don‚Äôt like the textures of foods. I have eaten several Nature Valley bars and they weren‚Äôt bad, I just didn‚Äôt like the way it feels when I eat it. These wafer bars have helped me put in about 400 to 600 calories. I‚Äôm a distance runner and I‚Äôm trying to gain weight but also balance it out with running and my workouts. The wafer itself doesn‚Äôt stick to the roof of your mouth like cheap wafers do. I love these Pretzel Peanut Butter kind and the one that just has oats on top of it. I could eat these for days.",5.0
Amazing find!,5.0

"While a bit pricey, these were great! I also teach and my students said they sounded ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù but when they tried them, they loved them (They are 10/11 yo). The jalape√±o is my favorite, the black pepper/salt was my least favorite, but still good. Healthier alternative to traditional chips!",5.0

Great flavor not greasy good crunch just the right amount of salt,5.0

"Nice option for a salty snack but I bought a huge case I gave away. I like the concept and the flavor but I found the texture dry and unsatisfying vs crackers or chips (that I‚Äôm trying to avoid). A little rice cakey. I always needed a beverage. No complaints about the ingredients, flavor and concept.",3.0

Great machine for popcorn!!,5.0

"The most traumatic experience ever, buy it at your own risk. The machine caught fire the first time I used it, and there were other family members who were in the house as well, jeopardising not just my life but the lives of my other family members. We had to extinguish the fire using a fire extinguisher.When I tried to return it, it was a whole other traumatic experience. Shipping it back itself costs >USD290, and after several back and forths with the terrible Amazon customer service team, they promised that the shipping fee will be refunded back to me as long as I produce an invoice.So after it was shipped, I sent the invoice to them and they then say that the shipping fee will be refunded as AMAZON PROMOTIONAL CREDIT.DO NOT - I REPEAT - DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE. I spent so many hours trying to process the refund and going back and forth, wasting my time and my money.",1.0

This unit is well made and has stood up very well to weekly use. It is easy to use. It can be hard to clean the inside glass because it's small but still 5 stars in my opinion.,5.0
"I was happy with this machine at first.  Made great tasting popcorn.  Machine is very hard to clean though.  After limiting use and always cleaning after using it, the top on the inside started rusting making it unusable.  The rust falls into the popcorn.  See the attached picture.  What a waste of money.

If you plan on doing to batches back to back the concentrator is HOT if you do back to back it will blow a hole because these are not as high quality as the ones from 15 plus years ago however if you remove the ""hot"" one set it aside install another one and use it you will get 5 plus out of each one easy what kills them is multiple times when still hot.  the concentrator comes in and out zero effort less then 1 second delay. if you are to lazy to swap it out then go for it just remember when you blow a hole in the one you were to lazy to swap out you will now have to do it ruining a batch of popcorn as well as 3 minutes of your time . so go ahead just leave the hot one in I warned you. you cant fix stupid after all",5.0

"Although the bag was sealed and full, it only had almonds, raisins, and cranberries. It was completely missing yogurt, peanuts, dates, and cashews. If you're in the same boat, just get a refund under the ""wrong item"" option, unless you like all almonds.",1.0
"This yogurt trail mix is tasty, but the delivery was disappointing. It was delivered during a warm spell, and all the yogurt pieces melted. The only way to avoid this is not to order these when it will be hot in your area.(But there wasn't a lot of yogurt in there anyway, so if the main reason you're ordering this is because you want yogurt, you might want to reconsider.)",3.0
"I have tried several of the Happy Belly Trail Mixes with good results. The Yogurt Trail Mix seems too bland to Me-there are several ingredients that should make it appealing such as Dried Cranberries which have a strong flavor normally but in this particular mix the Raisins seem to overide the Cranberry Flavor. The mix seems lacking to Me, probably won't purchase again. Best, PawPaw C",3.0
"Balloons were so hard to inflate because of the valves.  Couldn't even get a straw into some.  They kept popping as soon as I touched them.  The ones that I was able to blow up and inflate were dead the next day except 1 of them, which is still inflated from 4 days ago.  I would not buy these again as the mylar/foil is too thin!  I stopped even trying after trying to inflate 8 of them and only 3 of them ssemi made it to the garland!",1.0

"I am conflicted on how to review these balloons.  A straw for inflation would be a helpful addition to the packaging, for sure.  The round balloons inflated very easily and looked nice.  The balloons shaped like candy in a wrapper were more than difficult‚Ä¶one finally inflated but didn‚Äôt stay that way.  The others shaped like that wouldn‚Äôt even inflate.  For the price, we were still in good shape.  However, we were left in a bit of a mess because we had planned to use all 21 and could not. My best advice is to know when purchasing that up to a third might not inflate and have a Plan B or purchase a different bundle.",3.0

On a positive note the ingredients have not changed and no change in quality with the new corporate owners.It is a tasty, chewy typical fruit nut bar - nothing remarkable but a great price and ROCK BOTTOM compared to all the grocery stores, convenience stores that sell it nationwide.I don't buy this item a lot because the packaging is that foil plastic stuff that cannot be recyled and winds up in oceans plastic gyre.

My gf introduced them to me after these bi-fruity delights had their run with the general public and were then discontinued for some reason. So, with the duo's still melting in my jaws, I scoured the web. My realization was the truth that they truly have been discontinued.. not many packages exist.Personally, I haven't really scavenged for rarities or obsessed over expired things until now. My gf loves these starburst duos, but she doesn't know that I am also I love with them. While she was searching for them online I heard her say ""wha? YummyStarburstDuo dot com is out!?"" Yes hun, they're gone from this earth ;)So, I have been buying these whenever we are down to a few bags left and it makes me seem like the hero and good bf for finding more of these as they become available.I want to buy the rest of the existing bags from Amazon.

"MOST (95%) of the pecans were very fresh and flavorful. Unfortunately a significant amount, at minimum 5%, were rancid. Rancid means the oils are oxidized, and although NOT harmful, the taste is bad. Since, rancid or fresh, they all look alike one can never tell until you bite into it. Someone mixed an old batch with a new crop and thereby compromised the whole lot. Shame on you!  I will buy pecans from Happy Belly again because maybe it was a one time accident, and the good ones were very good, but if ANY are rancid in the next purchase, that will be FINIS!",2.0

"I can not eat too many type of nut, but pecans are one I can, so picked these up in the salted and non-salted versions to try. Obviously the salted ones taste better at first, but after eating them both for a while I actually prefer the non-salted now. They flavor comes through a lot more and these are some pretty tasty nuts. I have bought them a few times now and for the most part they have been pretty fresh...my most recent bag  were very fresh. But it is a little bit of a crap shoot although I have not had any stale ones yet...so thumbs up there. For the most part the bags usually have mostly good size chunks versus a lot of crumbles - but again that can vary.Over all though the Happy Belly are a good quality brand of pecans and I have tried a few....some even more expensive.

"At first taste, I felt like I was seven years old again. I didn't remember Mott's was so sweet, but the flavor struck me as unchanged. After many years, I still love the stuff.",5.0
So hard to find Motts applesauce in the grocery store when you need it. This solved problem. Large jars that will last months. So happy to have found them at Amazon.,5.0
I like the stuff it's tasty but it was delivered this time to someone else somewhere else due to delivery person being unable to read street numbers. But I am certain that whoever got it is enjoying it,5.0

"I had purchased once before with no issues. I like Moon pies IF they are fresh and soft.  These had not reached their usage date. But they were very dry and crumbly. The outer chocolate was actually flaking off. The only solution was to microwave 10 seconds, which made it hold together and become edible. Likely I will not purchase again.",2.0
"I like these anyway and was happy to find them on here, they were affordable but I had to cancel the subscription due to the constant price increase. Not worth it anymore. Everytime I turned around the price spiked for no reason and without warning.  Better to just go get a box for $1 at the store.",5.0
Great gift and good size for sharing.,5.0
This box of pies were not fresh. The chocolate had fade. They were  old . And crumbly. I know the freshness when I see . I order these box of pies before. And they were good. I will not order them again. I do not recommend them to anyone else.,2.0
They were great,5.0
"Then thin original Moon Pie box was placed in an envelope for shipping.  It was smashed during transit and half the pies are are mostly crumbled pieces.Apparently, there is no way to return them or ask for replacements.",1.0
The last batch of these I purchased were hard and felt like my teeth were going to break off. This is not normally the case.I like the ingredients in here for a more natural processed snack. The flavor is good and the nuts have enough fat and protein to keep you energized for a while. The chocolate on the back/bottom makes you feel like you‚Äôre giving yourself a treat as well.,3.0
They we're close to expiration date so probably why they were on special price and kind of hard to chew. You really had to work at it,3.0
"Per Kind ingredients, these are healthy and great for our children and ourselves. So enjoy and don't feel guilty eating or serving them.",5.0

"This is a rare and outstanding combination of my priorities: whole grain, low-cal, substantial and crispy. For wildly delicious crispiness, I think it‚Äôs worth putting them in the oven at 250 for 6 minutes. For a healthy-enough dessert, I dip a corner in reduced-sugar strawberry jam. It‚Äôs surprisingly excellent.",5.0

"These are the BEST pickle chips! They‚Äôre just spicy enough with the fantastic pickle flavor. I‚Äôve tried so many pickle chips from the grocery store, and it is still 100% worth it to order these by the box.  I don‚Äôt eat a ton of chips but it‚Äôs so handy to have a box of them on hand for when the craving strikes.",5.0
Taste great! Tastes like a spicy dill pickle without too much vinegar taste like the other pickle chip brands have.,5.0
"The chips were made in Connecticut for many years, they were delicious until they sold the company or moved it to Carolina and since then they SUCK !",1.0
Definitely not what I expected at all. Didn‚Äôt have an pickle taste at all. Just tasted like regular kettle chips with salt.,2.0

my new favorite chips!!!,5.0
"While I didn't get anything off of these chips in the heat department, and I must say these are some of the crunchiest chips I've had, The only burn I got off these is the super intense Vinegar.  So powerful is the vinegar, my tongue hurts.  I love dill pickle chips, but the vinegar is a bit much for me.  Good chips otherwise.  I can eat spicy foods that will burn off varnish, but this is a different kind of intensity.  Enjoy if you can handle intense vinegar, otherwise watch out.",4.0

Very disappointed to see chips expire with 7 days of purchase. That is something that must be disclosed before buying. I would not had purchased knowing this... I already opened package so didn't initiate a return. buyer beware,1.0
There was nothing wrong with my chips. They were still in date. I would recommend checking the dates on the bags. I didn‚Äôt mind paying what I did due to the fact that they will be out of date in about five months. They tasted fresh and were the perfect serving size! It‚Äôs a great choice to put into a lunch bag. Id buy them again.,5.0

Love these cookies. Great taste not bitter or too strong. Amazon please instruct your package handlers that a cookie box needs a box for shipping. Putting the cookies in a blister package envelope didn't protect the cookies and 1/2 arrived broken. was going to return but not worth trouble. Please fix this issue have had other cookies arrive the same way. Can't serve broken cookies to guest. Thank you.,4.0

I was extremely impressed with the flavor. I ate a few out of the box just to try it before I made banana pudding from scratch I was extremely impressed how they held up in the banana pudding however I can't say they lasted very long the banana pudding got ate up in less than 2 days and I made a huge batch it was a full size glass cookware because I did a homemade meringue top over the banana pudding this is the same glass dish I use for biscuits and full sheet cake and my deep dish homemade pizza I had bought the regular size vanilla wafers and the mini size from the same company and will be ordering more because they were absolutely delicious üòã..,5.0

Most important is less sugar however this is still a bit too sweet but will do.,5.0
"Have had a difficult time getting dried cranberries with less sugar in local stores. Online a lot of pricing ranges and sometimes questionable short or absent detail make purchasing a challenge. So when I saw this product and found it checked almost every box, I have continued using it. As a diabetic I realize no sugar is the goal, but the shelves are fairly bare of the quality you hope for at a price you can afford. So far, I am willing to risk and limit the sugar for a quality product that allows for less sugar.",5.0
"I was hoping they would simply reduce the amount of sugar, but NO they replaced the sugar with Sucralose - very gross!!!",2.0

"met. Probably won't buy these again, at least not in a variety pack. Too many bags to buy, just to taste each flavour, only to find out that the only flavour you really like is the cheese one. I first tasted the cheese flavour when I bought them at a Starbuck's, and was excited to try the other flavours, as the cheese ones were so good. But the Barbecue ones were the worst! If I buy these again, it won't be in a variety pack! üòï",3.0

"I don't usually write reviews. The only thing that moves me to is when something is extremely positive, and I like to stray from writing the negative bc I feel I could just let it be an L and move on.

"Very tasty. It's pretty hot! Nothing crazy but definitely hotter than their other flavors. It's more of a spicy ramen flavor to me than a spicy tteokbokki flavor if that makes sense. Bigger container than the tteokbokki only ones, more food.",5.0
"I give it 4 stars because for coming from the microwave they have a really great texture & the taste is great. However, they are VERY VERY VERRYYYYYY SPICY. I handle spice well, I'm obsessed with spicy food & would say I have a higher tolerance than most. These are insanely hot. And I know what you're thinking...those of us warning how hot it is have to just be weak..nothing is ever as spicy as they say. I KNOW, I wouldn't believe the reviews either. 99% of the time when things are labeled ""spicy"" I'm left disappointed. But this is different.. I've never audibly whined while eating something...like each bite was painful. It was delicious & I love spicy food so I liked the challenge and kept eating through it but man...this has to be up there with those ""one chip challenge"" and ghost pepper trends out there. I kept thinking what level this would be if I were on ""Hot Ones""..and I swear it's easily at the top somewhere. I wouldn't buy this level of spice again, stick to the package with only one chili on it.",4.0

I was happy my slum jim order came in and I opened my first one and yuck! Super dried out like an over microwaved piece of meat! Then I opened another to check if it may have been just one and the 2nd piece was just as bad. I opened a few more and all were tough like they may have been stored in a hot dry climate. I figured I would return them but unfortunately no they don't accept returns. These will become expensive dog treats if they don't make me sick. I'm disappointed for sure!,1.0

This brand has the BEST truffles no matter which flavor you get but dark chocolate lava is my favorite. They can be a bit expensive but if you are not in a hurry different venders go up and down on the regular and you can hit a good deal if you just pack your patience!!,5.0
These truffles are so delicious. Lady Godiva chocolate is the best. Con:  I eat too many. Lol,5.0

I like cracker jacks but this company sux. It was ordered two weeks ago then POOF.... nothing. Trust this company at your own peril.,1.0
The only thing missing was the prize inside like in the box.,4.0
Package arrived open and i needed exactly 12 so now I don't know what to do because the package is ineligible for return,1.0
And 10th bag was broken open and spilled all over the package. So website says 12 but I only  ended up with nine bags that I could eat.,2.0
Product had best by date by 2 months.  Must have been stored on the top shelf in the warehouse. Sticky and squishy.  Popcorn stuck together. Last box was fine.  This batch was bad.,2.0

Bought a box for my family and they all loved them!,5.0
I mean they taste fine and that‚Äôs cool and all but I won‚Äôt order from Amazon again since they are all broken to small pieces. Like I would be shocked if 30% of the crackers were intact. First time ordering food from Amazon and likely will be my last unless the thing isn‚Äôt breakable,2.0
Love them,5.0
"My children love these.  Great deal for 6 boxes, we are stocked for awhile.",5.0
Tasty!  Family added their favorite cheeses to them for a nice snack,5.0
Order them separately. They sometimes are all smashed to crumbs when packed with other things in the box,5.0
I love these crackers and making little pepperoni and cheese sandwiches with them which are great for a party tray. I just wish they didn't arrive with most of them shattered. I had to open three bags just to form one bag of unbroken crackers.,5.0
It is a great deal considering how expensive these are in the store. My family enjoyed them.,4.0
Delicious!,5.0
Something wrong. All the nut were wet  all thrown away,2.0

Loved the concept hated the taste,2.0
The texture and flavor are the bomb! I can not stop eating them once I start. So light and fun to eat. The peanut butter is my favorite. But I had to back off them because they are so light you can chow down a bag in minutes. Haha. So this is my go to treat when I want something sweet.,5.0
"I love Chex Peanut butter chocolate Muddy Buddies, but this batch from Amazon was a HUGE disappointment!!  They are just powdered sugar coated Chex.  They totally left out the chocolate & peanut butter.  Will try to return if I can!!!",1.0

very disappointed. the bars expired in 2022!,1.0
"I eat a lot of different protein bars, granola bars, but this is one of my favorite bars to have as a snack during the day or before a workout to get a bit of calories and carbs in. The taste is pretty good and based with dates which I enjoy and gives it a more natural taste and texture versus fruit or granola bars.",5.0
"I discovered this was a very tolerable snack to eat with severe chronic nausea. Calorie dense, with a good amount of fat and mild in flavor. This bar is fulfilling especially when you cannot eat much. 10/10.",5.0

"Food allergies are real. WARNING-company does not clearly state peanuts are in their CHOCHLATE CHIP COOKIE DOUGH bar.My son grew up with an allergy to peanuts. He was taught at an early age to read labels. People that know him knows he reads labels and very careful about what he eats. He got up during the night and decided to have a snack. He ate a L√§rabar Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough. Within a short time, we lost him. Yes, an EpiPen was used.  Ôøº also, when the ambulance arrived, he was given several doses with an EpiPen.  ÔøºHis allergy was to peanuts not cashews, pecansÔøº etc (tree nuts). It was only peanuts that he suffered allergic reactions growing up. I have included pictures of what he ate that night. The tragedy it led to that should‚Äôve never happened. Ôøº He passed away in a short amount of time of eating this small bar.I am sharing the story, because I never ever want this to happen to another family over a food/peanut allergy . Especially, when a Ôøºcompany does not clearly state peanuts are in their products.Hug your love ones close tonight!",1.0
These are addicting. Are they really good for you- I don't know but they fill me up and taste great on the go.,5.0
"It's a relatively standard fruit/nut bar with some chocolate pieces throughout, which tastes good. There's really no reason to describe it as cookie dough flavored, you can look at the ingredients and see that there's no reason why it would taste like cookie dough, but if yo're willing to use your imagination, then it's cookie dough flavored.",4.0
"These taste great - much better than a candy bar, and much healthier.  Buying them on Amazon - especially on subscribe & save - is much more economical (& faster) than waiting for a grocery store sale.  Love that there is no added sugars and no preservatives or unpronounceable chemical ingredients.",5.0
"My son eats this bar in this flavor daily. I have tried inserting others such as chocolate or chocolate truffle, but this is the only one he sticks with. We have a subscription to ensure we have enough for each day at school for snack. Sometimes the box comes crushed and sometimes they are more fresh than others, but my son still eats them.",4.0
They knew with a dukes label they could sell garbage. Oversalted and underwhelming,1.0

Tasted like nothing I bought the Cajun Andouille and there was no flavor at all. Much like cardboard. Do not bother ‚Ä¶,1.0
"I've never written a review in which I complained about excessive price.  I began to hone my skills at making red beans and rice like I'd had in my childhood in Arkansas, and I ordered ingredients from Amazon.  I now know that nearly everything can be had locally, but I'm now in Hawaii, so andouille sausage is not readily available.  Duke's cajun andouille sausage is the best I've found, but it is too darned expensive.  There are dozens of brands made in Louisiana and surrounding states, but the barrier is shipping.  Costco in Hawaii has a chicken andouille sausage that tastes nothing like what it should.  No other manufacturer will ship to Hawaii because of cost and spoilage.  So I'm going to learn how to make my own with locally sourced ingredients.  We have wild pigs wandering our highways . . . and smokers at Home Depot.",3.0
"I love the original and spicy flavor... I like andoullie sausage, but this one doesn't taste good at all.",1.0
"This is a somewhat unique review of a food product purchased on A-zon.  I have nuffin to complain about. I ordered four pouches of this product on 9/24/22 with the understanding that they would be delivered between 10/10 and 10/20/22.  The package arrived on 10/6/22 (early).As for the product, HAPPILY mine were NOT SHORT-DATED!  My 5 oz pouches expire in April and July 2023.  My first pouch (opened) contains 11 smoked shorty sausages.  While moderately but more than acceptably firm (in texture) for a dried product, they are not nearly so hard to chew as those disgusting Slim Jims.  Likewise, these casings are easy to penetrate (unlike Slim Jims which are so God aweful tough to chew, they need to be peeled to consume).  As for the flavor, I'ld describe them as Smokey, INTENSE Manhatten Clam Chowder  (which appeals to me).  Two shorties (25g) are 130 Cals (10g Fat; 7G Protein; 270mg Sodium).  I'ld rate them a 4.7.So, there ya go.  I hope I've covered all pertinent info that allows you to make an informed purchasing decision.  MOI  10/2022",4.0

Excellent taste and great price!,5.0
The quality of the salsa is great. Been using this brand since the 1990s.  I add lime and cilantro to mine when I have it. I also like the small portion cans. Cold refrigerated salsa grosses me out. Open a little can and I'm done. I'm not feeding a big family so I prefer these individual sized cans.,5.0
2 of the 3 cans were noticeably dented. Wary of cooking with this now,1.0
This salsa actually has a pretty fresh flavor to it. The can is not very big though. About enough salsa for 1 or 2 people to have with some chips for a snack.,4.0

"I got the six boxes of 9 cookies per box.  The cookies tasted great, as do all Walkers Shortbread cookies. However, all the cookies were broken into small pieces.

I gave it five stars because for an Atkins cookie I loved it but the shipping box was all dented in and my cookies were broken when I opened the package of one. I ordered three boxes.

The last batch of these I purchased were hard and felt like my teeth were going to break off. This is not normally the case.I like the ingredients in here for a more natural processed snack. The flavor is good and the nuts have enough fat and protein to keep you energized for a while. The chocolate on the back/bottom makes you feel like you‚Äôre giving yourself a treat as well.,3.0
They we're close to expiration date so probably why they were on special price and kind of hard to chew. You really had to work at it,3.0

"I developed a love for dried fruit while engaging in hiking, backpacking, and camping, as it makes for a great snack and will not spoil, as some other foods will.

I'll definitely buy from this seller again.",5.0

A mixture would be nice.  What's in the bag bears no relationship to the photo.,3.0
"This product is very good. The fruits have good flavor (if a bit too sweet). The fruit is still chewy and there's quite a bit of each fruit. The one problem is, there is sooooo much pineapple.

"This listing is misleading. It states it‚Äôs a bundle, under size it says ‚Äútwo-pack‚Äù. This would indicate that ordering a quantity of one (bundle) should get you two 3.5 lb bags. Further down under number of items, it says ‚Äúone‚Äù. One package? One bundle of two? I ordered two, expecting based on the listing to get four bags‚Ä¶.but I only received two. Just wanted to make people aware. The product itself is great. Fresh and tasty. I gave it three stars for value simply because the price of prunes has tripled, or worse, in the last year. They were very hard to get for awhile, reportedly due to a bad growing season. Now they‚Äôre available‚Ä¶.just exorbitantly expensive regardless of where you purchase them",5.0
Prunes are famous for their fiber and healthful benefits.  These are the best I've tasted and are very helpful.,5.0

"Please be aware this ad is only for a 3.5 oz pkg.  The ad sounded like it is for 2-3.5 oz pkg.  With this in mind, the cost is about double what the local Costco charges.",1.0
The product is fine. The wording of the sale of item was deceitful as I thought it was 2 - 3.5 lbs of prunes for the price.  It was price gouging being they can be bought at Costco for $10.50 per 3.5 lb bag.,3.0

I thought the bowl seemed less full recently. At first I thought maybe I'd just gotten some old bags but there were never many leftover unpopped kernels. Then I found an old box in the back of the cupboard from last year and I compared the weights. The old box was almost 20 oz and the new one is 16oz.

These are my sons favorite. They are very tasty,5.0
"I've bitten into several of these before and they are delicious!In case you may not remember, years ago, Carnation had those breakfast energy bars that had chocolate on the outside and on the inside, they had chocolate chips and other things, which I can't remember and every time I do bite into a fudge-dipped chocolate chip chewy granola bar, it reminds me of those days and they are definitely one I recommend.",5.0
Good product at a good price,5.0
Try 'em with peanut butter... Delicious üòãü§§!,5.0
"I had bought a box of these on a whim in a store back in June, planning on using them for a workday snack or dessert for lunch. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried them, the granola bars were genuinely soft and chewy with a good layer of chocolate around the bar.  The box was fresh and recent enough that I decided to get some more, and when the store I went to previously was out of stock, I ordered more here. Again, the bars I have eaten have been fresh, chewy, and quite tasty. The only real downside to these are that the bars themselves are rather small,  only 1.1 oz. They are a good size for kids and young teens but not quite enough for much more then whetting the appetite of an adult.",4.0
"Just wish the use by date was longer, but good product.",4.0

"The product is what was expected. However, this is the 3rd package from Amazon that was delivered to my neighbors due to the driver not reading instructions. This happens most of the time and I am disabled.",5.0
Actually cheaper than the grocery store and it‚Äôs the exact same thing,5.0
"I bought this exact pack last month and none of the bags are popping in the microwave. I tried 4 different bags from 4 out of the 6 different boxes with the same result - the kernels do not pop, the oil gets hot and leaks into the microwave. And I went t mo Orville‚Äôs website and there are several (5-10?) recent reviews talking about the same issues - no popping, just burning.Other brands of popcorn work fine in my microwave so I can only infer the quality control is not good. Being so frustrated I don‚Äôt see myself buying this brand ever again.",1.0
Love  This  Popcorn!  It  Tastes  So  Good.  Mostly  99%  Popped  Kernels.  Just  Set  Ur  Microwave  For  2  Minutes.  The  Aroma  Of  This  Popcorn  Is  Inviting  &  Taste  So  Good.  Excellent  Value  For  The  Money,5.0
"Next best thing to popcorn from a regular full size popping machine as found in movie houses, etc.",5.0
Started my 13yr old gson on Orville. His parents say he won't eat any other kind. I like that it is more natural than other brands. Only popcorn better is the Orville popcorn seeds you have to cook yourself.,5.0
"I was discouraged when I realized this is ONE BOX of 6 packages of popcorn, not 6 boxes of 6 packages. For the quantity, it is extremely overpriced.",2.0
"Great popcorn and love the taste, but half the bags in this order of 6 boxes would not pop. About 1/4 of each of the defective bags popped. If I tried for longer time the popped corn would burn and still wouldn‚Äôt pop fully. :-/ we won‚Äôt be purchasing them again.",2.0
Absolutely the BEST popcorn EVER,5.0
Great popcorn for the money.,5.0

"Peanut was my favorite granola bar. I indulged every day. Until I replenished my supply and, on taking my first bite, realized that my beloved was no more. This once rubenesque bar was but a sad, shrunken, shadow of her former self. Sweet and flimsy, she delights but for a moment before leaving me empty, hungering for something more. I have long preferred a weightier kind of love. Especially for breakfast. Goodbye, Peanut. I loved you once.",2.0

"These bars were months from expiration but unfortunately most of them were already moldy. I tried the first one after receiving it and I didn‚Äôt like it much but they were for my toddler anyway.

Mix it up and then wait an hour and you end up with a pretty tasty salsa!",5.0

I clearly must‚Äôve gotten a bad batch sent to me. The taste was absolutely disgusting from both containers.  Extremely old and hard to chew through the caramel. The chocolate on the outside was all faded in color and tasted very disappointing compared to the same product that I‚Äôve had before. I purchased one as a gift for a family member and was quite embarrassed when they tasted it and even commented on how it tasted unusually different and nowhere near as good as they remembered. Definitely some thing that I should be refunded for.",1.0

Each bag of  All Sorts contains a variety of pieces with a number of different flavors.  No 2 bags are exactly alike but each bag has a great selection of treats.  Settle into your most comfy seat and enjoy each separate morsel one at a time while watching an old mystery movie!  The bag will be empty before you realize it!My very highest grade goes to the vendor.  I placed 2 orders last fall and they both came quickly.  My third order was placed near the end of November but it never arrived.  I contacted the vendor in January and received an apology and a replacement within an extremely short period of time.  I am very impressed with his professional and responsible attitude and would like others to know that this vendor is exceptional and trustworthy.,5.0
"Our household loves licorice, but others don't love up to Bassett's Allsorts in our estimation. The only drawback is that from some places, it is not fresh when it arrives. This was perfect.

Had to process a return and reorder rather than just sending out a new one. This box finally came but also badly damaged. But the bags inside were fine. Product itself very good.,4.0

"When in my local grocery store, the bags are full of flavor and you can tell the difference in seasoning powder versus when I order these here. Every other time I order them from here, the batches are hardly flavorful and spicy.

I think I‚Äôll just have to stock up from the ones sold at my grocery store.",2.0

"MY FAVORITE CHIPS NOW. I am a hot Cheetos fan, and this is the healthy version of that. I had a lot of people try a few straws, and they agreed that it is a healthy version of a hot cheeto. I like that for the pricing you get 6 big bags, and they last quite a while. You can't beat the calorie intake with how many chips you end up eating. This is a great healthy alternative to a hot chip in your home. I just wish they carried these in the grocery stores in my area.",5.0

No flavor on the chips,4.0
"Normally product is on par. But this time when I took the 2nd bag out of box air came out with any compression. Then I checked the rest of the 4 bags, and all had air easily coming out!!

No place I see who to contact about replacement. Return time frame over now.",5.0
Ate one small bag on an empty stomach an hour before bed woke up puking in the morning. Highly acidic if you eat these even with food in your stomach you feel a little bad. I didn't go into work this morning been awake for 3 hours and I still feel bad. I'm done with Highly processed foods.,1.0

This is a small handful of fried cauliflower bits and pieces in a tiny bag. The pieces are flavorless and sad and taste like whatever oil they were drowned in.Waste of money.,1.0
"I chowed down on these really fast, and wish the bag was bigger to hold more.",5.0
"I first tried these at Juice Press at Equinox gym and I was immediately hooked. They are the perfect blend of salty-sweet-crunchy and really hit the spot when you want a healthyish snack. I gave 3 stars for value because once in while I come across flourettes that are overdried and too hard to bite into, almost like cooked rice if it dries out. I actually wish they came in a big bag but maybe it's all for the best since smaller packs keeps in check.",5.0
This is one of the absolute worst products I have ever purchased. Very little flavor and you might lose a filling when eating.  One bite and the bag went in the trash.,1.0

These Cauliflower Bites are terrible.  They taste stale and loaded with salt.  I would not recommed them to anyone.,1.0
The dill seasoning is good and different.  Great for snacking.,4.0
"Please know the delivery/transaction went great. Fast shipping. This was my first time trying these. I was intrigued, as I love dill. I really wanted to love these but sadly it was dill overkill. Just an overwhelming amount of dill power that could easily be cut down by half. The flavor itself is good, there‚Äôs just way too much of it. Made me do a bitter face. Hope they consider toning it down a notch.. making the cashew the star and not the dill. Thank you.",3.0
The flavor combination is a hit. Cashews are big and crunchy. The only thing wrong with these is I didn't order a bigger bag.,5.0
Oh my! What flavor these have so great!  Need to buy more!,5.0
"very good, very salty",5.0
"It never surprises me that the big names always contribute to the biggest waste in packaging and also tip you in value. I bought two flavors one begin dill and other cinnamon sugar (which is my favorite) yes it was less then half full which just pissed me off, the flavor its person preference so its strong if you like dill pickle but wasn't my cup of tea. based on value these should be a $1 for how much you get, I litterly bought a dollar pack of cashews from Wawa and dumped them out and I fill theses dill into it it was tight but still proves my point for how little they give you and waste space in the bag its over priced --- stop supporting over priced products and big companies that contribute to wasted packaging space. we need to be a better community to fight this.",2.0

Received quickly and as promised,5.0
Small pack.  Nothing special .  Large nuts .  Not broken.,3.0
"Sometimes you just want a little something that's crunchy and salty. A little added tang is a plus. These Planters dill pickle cashews are the perfect fix for that gnawing craving. I can go through a can of nuts like an oversized squirrel, but I find just a few of these cashews can satisfy a craving. I'll be making this a permanent addition to my pantry.

"I love Charleston Chews.  It tastes like a cup of Hot Cocoa on a cold evening.  I love the taste, the chocolate part to taste like cocoa and then once the chocolate is off the inside vanilla and other colors now too taste like melted marshmallow.  I love the ""chew"" to the candy.  There are a lot of them, but it is kind of expensive, but not if you love them like I do.  They do have a subscribe and save for this,  I am on the list.  One of my most favorite things to do with this is to keep them cold in the refrigerator.  They are especially tasty like this and last longer.  What I dislike is the static electricity of the paper wrapper.  You can't seem to get them off your fingers and before you know it.  You have tons of them and in fact I almost thought I ate and swallowed a small piece of one, that kind of bothered me.  Hopefully it will come out as easy as it went in.  No charge to the paper to zap you just you could end up eating a paper or two.  I highly recommend them with or without the additional charge, that is electricity, no pun was intended.  Now for them to work on a new paper wrapper.",5.0

"The only one who thought this was sour was a 4 yr old.. it lasted for only a few seconds for the rest of us, not enough to make them eyes water or anything. If anything it's just a really nasty flavor in general that makes you hate it.

It‚Äôs is sooooo sour but so good at the same time,5.0
I got these because they are supposedly the most sour candy around. I was so excited. I put one in my mouth and honestly it is no different then a war head. I was very disappointed in the actual sourness of the candy. However I will say that the flavor itself was very good. I would buy it again just because of that. The sourness though no. 4/10 in terms of sourness and 8/10 flavor wise.,2.0

"If you're searching for ""the sourest candy,"" then look no further. I have never experienced a candy so sour. I can only keep the candy in my mouth for around 10 seconds at a time because my entire being shrivels from sourness.

I don't recommend eating more than 1 a day or you will destroy your mouth/tongue.",5.0

Ive never had such a bad thing of big league  chew in my entire life.  Its like it just crumbled into a mushy dust once I started to chew it. It would not get turned into normal gum when you start to chew it. It was more like eating candy not gum.,1.0
